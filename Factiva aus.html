<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORMER Test spinner Steve O’Keefe has called on <b>Australia</b> to bring Tim Paine back from cricketing exile and supercharge the Big Bash League this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the BBL’s most experienced players, O’Keefe says <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> owes Paine a debt for what he did to rescue the Test team in the wake of sandpapergate and should be offering the fallen captain a chance to exit the game on his terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O’Keefe says <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span>’s recruitment drive cannot end with David Warner’s signature and must do whatever it takes to financially incentivise big stars like Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to play this summer… and is adamant Paine should be at the top of any hit list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paine took an indefinite <b>mental health</b> break in the wake of his sexting scandal last summer, but has not actually retired from any form of cricket and Hobart Hurricanes boss Ricky Ponting has already declared he wants the 37-year-old Tasmanian great back involved in the Big Bash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m happy to sit here and say I think it would be a great move for CA and the cricket community to get Tim Paine back playing and involved in cricket,” O’Keefe said. “Because of the work that he’d done when cricket was arguably going through its darkest moments –he brought us back into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One thing the game doesn’t do well is the exiting part of players’ careers. And it doesn’t sit well with me how he’s finished up. He’s a player who deserved a lot better. He missed the Hobart Test last summer. (CA should be saying), ‘come back and help the Hurricanes win their first BBL title and go out a home crowd hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(They should say) ‘we’ll top it up. We want you to do a bit of commentary, we want you to coach. We want you. Because of the service and what you’ve done for us, we’re going to look after you and we want you to grow the game for us rather than leave bitter and twisted.’ Test captain Pat Cummins rallied behind Paine last week at the Chappell Foundation dinner in Sydney raising money for youth homelessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He brought the Ashes back from a series over in England,” he said. That’s huge. Someone like Painey, firstly as a mate you want to make sure he’s OK. We all make mistakes. He did the wrong thing, but he tried to fix the situation as best as he could … I personally think it was a huge deal and I really feel for him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON’T BECOME A-LEAGUE O’Keefe fears the BBL could become like the A-League is in football in terms of its ranking amongst the big leagues of the world if <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> doesn’t embrace privatisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Good on CA for capturing lightning in a bottle early on. But now we’ve got to adapt and adapt quick because if we don’t we’ll fall behind and I don’t want us to fall into a trap where we’re the A-League of soccer and we’re the 10th ranked tournament compared to these other T20 leagues which have all the best ­players,” O’Keefe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAY STARS 60K A GAME O’Keefe says when CA is happy to pay $340,000 for overseas stars like Faf du Plessis to come out for eight matches, it shouldn’t hesitate over making the BBL too financially appealing for Aussie Test stars to ignore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pay them 60 grand a game out of the marketing pool,” O’Keefe said. “It might seem obscene, two hundred grand for a couple of games. But it’s not really. Last year in <b>Covid</b>, they (CA) hired a private jet to fly over eight English players and didn’t even sweat over it. Faf du Plessis is essentially on 50k a game, so it’s not crazy money to pay for David Warner when he’s a guy who will put an extra 10-15,000 bums on seats.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DRAFT TIPS O’Keefe can’t speak for the Sydney Sixers and its strategy for next Sunday’s draft, but in his opinion – retaining Englishman James Vince should be the priority along with signing a death bowler like Chris Jordan. Sydney Thunder also has a big ­decision whether to retain English opener Alex Hales when he’s only going to be available for the first part of the tournament.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sport can be ruthless on the field, but nothing compared to the unseemly and unfortunate coaching games that can play out off it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week Essendon’s Ben Rutten had to endure the ignominy of his employer shamelessly and publicly seeking the services of a more attractive replacement. His family have suffered that and the emotional turmoil of learning he had been sacked, only to find he had not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the year, in the summer sport, Justin Langer was thrown out of an office when he’d only recently placed a World Cup trophy and Ashes urn at Cricket <b>Australia</b> HQ because another suitor was deemed more suitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Melbourne beat Essendon in the bid to woo Alistair Clarkson. It wasn’t that long ago that rookie coach Rhyce Shaw left the place shattered after a year without support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darren Lehmann left cricket red eyed and aching and told The Weekend Australian that he entered a dangerous, dark place in the immediate aftermath. Langer spoke of somewhere depressingly similar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A previous Essendon coach, James Hird, attempted suicide after being cast into exile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s worse stories still not told out of respect for the broken, but a quick survey suggests coaching is an extreme sport that can have extreme consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former North Queensland Cowboys coach Paul Green’s funeral at a suburban football ground in Brisbane next week will be a day of unanswered questions and aching sorrow for friends and family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the sporting industry the popular coach’s passing has given fellow travellers further pause to consider the pressures of the life as a senior coach, the consequences of losing that job and the demands of life both inside and outside modern professional sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Who looks after the coach?” one asks. “You keep the place together, but who keeps you together? The expectations and demands are so high and then when it is done you are cut adrift.” The same senior coach admits to an “incredible amount of guilt” at the price a coach’s family pays. The absences mount and their accumulated toll awaits you when you are done, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it ends on your own terms there’s a solid foundation for the future, if you are chased out of office it is quite another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fellow coaches have watched with disappointment as Essendon joined the very public hunt for Clarkson’s signature as coach while the man stuck with the job, Rutten, endured the public humiliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this week 3AW’s Neil Mitchell reported Rutten had been “let go” and Daniel Giansiracusa would coach this weekend’s match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rutten is part of a semi-formal coaching group with members across the codes who sent out messages of support when they heard and then seethed at his treatment when they learned the day had not yet come and the news was wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They know how news like that affects family who hear it and know no better. A wife who frets for her husband, children who endure the playground reaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melbourne coach and friend Simon Goodwin said “the one thing you want in our industry is respect” and expressed hope Rutten “comes out the other side and is treated the right way”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A coach is often treated as a position not a person and the toll on coaches is significant, but rarely acknowledged Hird admitted after his suicide attempt: “I could not dig myself out of this hole.” North Melbourne fought to gain Clarkson’s signature, two years after Shaw was burnt out from the strain of running the club during the first year of <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He “didn’t get the support he needed”, brother Heath claimed at the time. Langer, who compared notes over a meal with Green during the 2020-21 summer, knows from the scarifying experience that losing the job can be dangerous for a person institutionalised by the role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Leadership can be very lonely,” Langer told The Australian. “If you haven’t got people privately and publicly supporting you, as I have, I imagine that can become a very, very, very lonely and dark place.” Speaking from Perth on his friend Green, Langer spoke of “Paul’s loss of purpose”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehmann, who left the Australian cricket coaching job in tears during the sandpaper scandal, had Green at his house for dinner recently. They’d both attended the funeral of mutual friend Andrew Symonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Boof” has been to too many funerals this year. He worked closely with Rod Marsh over the years and played with both Shane Warne and Symonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last weekend he and his mates from Ricky Ponting’s team got together in Melbourne for a hit of golf and more than a couple of beers at the St Andrews Beach Brewery, part-owned by David Warner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were, Lehmann admits, tears shed for mates lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What happened with Greeny was gut-wrenching for all of us up here,” he said. “He was over at our place for dinner two and a half weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was a very driven coach, probably misunderstood in the media a little bit. He was fun-loving and all that, he was obviously very serious when it came to footy.” Lehmann says he was “in a real bad way for a long period” after South Africa and recognises now that he was suffering a form of withdrawal amid all the controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You go to a bad, dark spot, it is like a drug has been taken away from you and if you are lucky you work through the positives with the help of different people,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You only know what’s going on in your own head. It’s difficult to know what’s going on in others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After South Africa I was in a real bad way for a long period. “You’ve got to come through the other side at some stage, hopefully. I moved on in a different direction and I didn’t want to still be a head coach, but Greeny still wanted to be a head coach.” Lehmann recalls a time he lost his temper with the media and stormed out of what was supposed to be a friendly dinner during the 2015 World Cup and says now that behaviour looks unhinged, but it was a result of pressures he was under.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You don’t get a lot of support, organisations don’t help, a lot of coaches have that issue,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Coaches are worked to the bone in the job, they love it and it’s the best job in the world, but you lose clarity in the role because the pressure is so great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You are away so much, the game consumes you and you lose perspective. You are trying to keep so many people happy and engaged you have no time for yourself and that is the problem there is no time for yourself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You go through a whole range of emotions, but once you work through there’s relief you get your life back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You start to wonder why you did this or that, I mean, why did I blow up at the media over dinner it <b>New Zealand</b>, that was ridiculous, but the job just takes its toll and you lose perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s why I don’t think you should coach for long, you should only do it for a World Cup cycle, no longer than that. JL and I were talking about it the other day.” The exit for him was difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It takes you months to get over it all,” he said. “You have to rediscover your relationships with your wife and kids and your home and you don’t want to travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m not cried out, but it was good at the weekend to check out with the others and see that we were all right. That’s what’s happening to men in their mid 40s and 50s.” Of Green he says, “he was a great father and husband and he just had something missing in his life that you couldn’t put a finger on. It was probably that head coaching role, but we don’t know.” Lehmann’s comments about withdrawal were echoed in an interview with Socceroos’ coach Graham Arnold in <span class="companylink">News Corp</span> papers this week when he said the adrenaline rush of the game was “a brutal drug”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In retirement you can feel worthless,” he said. “Coaches need purpose every day. The love of the game is in your heart, that love is in your body that you miss it so much … when you walk away, within a week, you’re a forgotten person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the old days you had two lives as a professional sportsman — a professional life and personal life. Now it’s just one life, there’s no balance.” Langer is also part of an informal coaching group which includes Rutten and leaders from all sports who catch up regularly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A board member at West Coast Eagles, he has watched with interest as the Essendon coach is humiliated while his club’s coach Adam Simpson has continued almost without question despite his side winning just two games this year “I’ve been really proud of the West Coast Eagles this year, we’ve had a poor year on the field and there are reasons for it, but the club’s stuck really tight,” he said. “The coach is very aware of where he stands with the footy club and the board and that’s really important.” Langer says the Essendon saga is a circus and the reporting poor. “I woke up one morning and saw that Ben Rutten had been sacked, I read it, Neil Mitchell reported it, I don’t know Neil Mitchell but he reported it,” he said. “That stuff takes its toll on your family and friends.” Langer said that the key to making the exit from the role is to find another purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I knew as Australian coach that my purpose every single day was to get up and stick to that mantra about making Australians proud of the team again, when I was a player I had absolute purpose and knew I had to watch the ball out of the bowler’s hand to score runs and if I did that I’d get a contract and that was my purpose,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You don’t have to be in a public role, there are huge suicide rates in <b>Australia</b> now and I imagine a lot of it has to do with a loss of purpose and perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Purpose and hope in life are important and if you don’t find them I imagine it is a dark hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For some it is absolute freedom when you come out the other side. The truth is in business and sport you can become institutionalised, you are told where to be, what to wear, you have a timetable every day and you become like prisoners who can’t go back into the outside world.” Langer took a little while to find his feet after <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> controversially refused to offer him a full contract renewal. despite wins in the Ashes and World Cup .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to put ointment on some battle scars,” he said. “I’ve never fallen out with one person in my life, never, not one person in my life, but there’s a few people I’ve dealt with in the last 12 months that I will find hard to look in the eye for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to find forgiveness, you have to find a way of letting go or it will eat you alive. That absolutely eats people alive, I imagine that would affect people who have been criticised or sacked and I imagine a lot of people find that to let go of.” Langer says one of his lifelines has been the informal coaching network that includes Rutten, Trent Robinson, Matt King, Luke Darcy, Don Pyke and John Worsfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither rugby league nor cricket has a professional coaches association, while the AFL’s is headed by former full back Alistair Nicholson, who played for Melbourne and previously headed up the Australian Cricketers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Langer says that Green’s death has brought home the need to be more active around <b>mental health</b> support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are keen to work with the AFL and the clubs on support for the coaches,” he said. “The senior coach is responsible for all the athletes underneath, the men and women who are striving to be the best they can be and if the senior coach is not as well supported as they can be that can have a huge impact. “The coach’s role has expanded so much, they are very much a manager, a developer of the culture, a driver of energy and it means the coach has relationships with all the players who want time with them and their families too. There’s also the media demands and the intense security.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting still, observing your bodily sensations… and no talking for 10 days. Sitting still, observing your bodily sensations… and no talking for 10 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One minute in thoughts: Home ... coffee ... chicken burritos ... someone give the guy up front a tissue ... who won the State of Origin last night? My lower back is screaming so I change my posture for the 20th time. The screaming moves to my shoulders. Now I can't feel my legs. I twist and shuffle, change again, but there's no relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated, I open my eyes and scan the room. I swear all the other backs are perfectly straight, all the other faces calm. Surely they're not enjoying this? Surely I'm not the only one struggling?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I sit cross-legged on the floor of a dimly lit hall in the West Australian bush. Winter rain hammers the roof and I crave the warmth of my sleeping bag. "Practise patiently and persistently," a deep voice urges from the loudspeaker. "You're bound to be successful ... bound to be successful!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not halfway through day one and I'm already feeling sharp pangs of regret. I've built a small mountain of blankets and cushions, but still can't seem to find a groove. To distract myself, I do a quick head count. There are about 40 men and women, of varying ages. None of us will say a word to each other for the next 10 days. Why am I here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On paper, Vipassana meditation sounds simple enough. It means seeing things for how they truly are. An ancient and non-sectarian technique, Vipassana directs people to observe the body's sensations without judgment or reaction. Through this inward experience we begin to understand the truth of impermanence and, in doing so, can develop a greater sense of inner peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good pitch, but does it "work"? Start by asking the scores of volunteers, or "servers", who help run Vipassana courses across <b>Australia</b> and globally each year. The courses are offered for free, relying on the donation of time and money from the many thousands who've reaped the technique's benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I first heard about it from a friend. She spoke glowingly about her Vipassana experience. I was interested, but also slightly sceptical: no talking for 10 days, no phones, no reading, no dinner! Why put yourself through this? But over time I became more curious. For a few years I'd been using a meditation app that focused on following the basic movement of breath. I'd do about 15 minutes daily or, depending on motivation, weekly, mainly as an attempt to calm my mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It worked to a point. It became a crutch throughout a stressful interstate move and career change, and then a necessity while battling blood cancer during the height of <b>Covid</b>, an experience I wrote about in June last year for this magazine. But even in the joy of full remission I would be frustrated by a persistent urge to control life's uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people began telling me about the benefits of learning Vipassana. Then, last Easter, I went online and saw that spots were still available for an upcoming 10-day course in June. I thought about it briefly before registering my interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six weeks later, on a freezing evening, I'm sheltering from torrential rain while sipping vegetable soup alongside dozens of strangers. I exchange nervous small talk with a marketing manager, a host of backpackers and a retired healthcare worker. The camp is near Brookton, about 130km southeast of Perth and a six-hour drive from my home in Esperance. A manager gives a brief welcome address. "One day, you'll hopefully be able to look back at this as one of the most important experiences of your lives," he says. He explains that the "noble silence" is about minimising distraction from the meditation and will begin at 8pm that night. Eye contact with other students is off-limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first stage of the course is dedicated to focusing on respiration and becoming more in touch with the elusive present moment. Day one is hard, day two harder and I seriously think about leaving on the third. It's mainly the cold and boredom. Finding the present moment is like finding cheap lettuce. How can I do this for another week?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I share a room with a forklift driver from Northam, a town northeast of Perth. It's small, but warm and comfortable enough. Others stay in larger dorms, while some even brought tents and campervans onto the grounds. We eat vegetarian meals for breakfast and lunch. Dinner? Fruit and green tea. A full stomach, we're told, is detrimental for meditation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time between sessions and meals is spent in search of sleep or, depending on the weather, roaming the lush, leafy grounds. Every afternoon I collect a small stick to mark the passing days. On nice evenings I watch the sun drop behind a neighbouring sheep farm. No phone snaps or filters; just watching, experiencing ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning we’re set a meditation challenge: three times a day we're required to maintain the same posture for a full hour, while routinely scanning our entire bodies to notice all sensations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is that by sitting objectively with sensations as they arise, change and fall away, we start to understand anicca - impermanence - in a more profound way. It's about accepting and allowing sensations, whether pleasant or not, rather than blindly reacting to them. "Anicca ... " the word is repeated over and over. "View your sensations with an understanding of anicca."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I decide to apply myself and, on the fifth evening, experience a breakthrough of sorts: I manage to sit through the full hour without moving a muscle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last 15 minutes are agony, but I keep reminding myself the pain is temporary. Anicca ... anicca.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I leave the meditation hall feeling lighter and sleep soundly until the 4am wake-up gong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 10 days, the final morning comes and goes in a blur. Most of the people I speak with seem to have reached a similar conclusion: glad it is over, but also happy to have done it. The key to enjoying long-term success, we're reminded, is practice. I vow to myself that I'll try the technique at home, though the recommended two hours a day sounds daunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over porridge and fruit stew, I strike up a conversation with one of the volunteers who's been working in the kitchen between group meditations. I am stunned to learn that this is his 12th Vipassana course. "You definitely notice the benefits," he says. "Your mind becomes sharper; it's just really good for your <b>mental health</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm somewhere inside Perth's Fiona Stanley Hospital. There are bright lights, masked faces and no windows; a muted game show plays on the TV above me. It's a familiar scene as I wait for my twice-yearly health scan. It's been almost a month since the Vipassana course ended. My commitment to practice has been hit-and-miss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started strongly, finding time every day. But that lasted less than a fortnight. For various reasons, I started convincing myself I was "too busy": work to do, groceries to buy, footy to watch. Now I'm meditating a few times a week. I'm waiting for the nurse, flicking through emails, when a thought floats into my mind: What if this scan doesn't go according to plan? Soon my head is swimming with unhelpful health hypotheticals and worst-case scenarios. My breathing quickens, my stomach tightens. Anicca ...</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Test spinner Steve O’Keefe has called on <b>Australia</b> to bring Tim Paine back from cricketing exile and supercharge the Big Bash League this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the BBL’s most experienced ever players, O’Keefe believes <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> owes Paine a debt for what he did to rescue the Test team in the wake of sandpapergate and should be offering the fallen captain a chance to exit the game on his terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O’Keefe says <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span>’s recruitment drive cannot end with David Warner’s signature and must do whatever it takes to financially incentivise big stars like Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to play this summer … and is adamant Paine should be at the top of any hit list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paine took an indefinite <b>mental health</b> break in the wake of his sexting scandal last summer, but has not actually retired from any form of cricket and Hobart Hurricanes boss Ricky Ponting has already declared he wants the 37-year-old Tasmanian great back involved in the Big Bash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O’Keefe believes it’s time for CA to chip in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m happy to sit here and say I think it would be a great move for CA and the cricket community to get Tim Paine back playing and involved in cricket,” O’Keefe told <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Because of the work that he’d done when cricket was arguably going through its darkest moments –he brought us back into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’d love nothing more than to have that bloke come out and play, it’d be a great story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One thing the game doesn’t do well is the exiting part of players’ careers. And it doesn’t sit well with me how he’s finished up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He’s a player who deserved a lot better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He missed the Hobart Test last summer. (CA should be saying), ‘come back and help the Hurricanes win their first BBL title and go out a home crowd hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(They should say) ‘we’ll top it up. We want you to do a bit of commentary, we want you to coach. We want you. Because of the service and what you’ve done for us, we’re going to look after you and we want you to grow the game for us rather than leave bitter and twisted.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t know where he’s at. I don’t know him that well, but getting him to play would be amazing. People would turn up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Test captain Pat Cummins also rallied behind Paine last week at the Chappell Foundation dinner in Sydney raising money for youth homelessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cummins said Paine deserved forgiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We certainly won’t forget him. He brought the Ashes back from a series over in England. That’s huge. That hasn’t been done for 20 years. He’s had some real significant accolades throughout his time,” Cummins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Someone like Painey, firstly as a mate you want to make sure he’s OK. We all make mistakes. He did the wrong thing, but he tried to fix the situation as best as he could … I personally think it was a huge deal and I really feel for him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON’T LET BBL BECOME LIKE THE A-LEAGUE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O’Keefe fears the BBL could become like the A-League is in soccer in terms of its ranking amongst the big leagues of the world if <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> doesn’t embrace privatisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Good on CA for capturing lightning in a bottle early on. But now we’ve got to adapt and adapt quick because if we don’t we’ll fall behind and I don’t want us to fall into a trap where we’re the A-League of soccer and we’re the 10th ranked tournament compared to these other T20 leagues which have all the best players,” said O’Keefe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m a fan of privatisation because you need a seat at the table with these guys who are organising these leagues. Imagine if the BBL one day had access to Virat Kohli?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAY AUSTRALIAN STARS $60K A GAME</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O’Keefe says when <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> is happy to pay $340,000 for overseas stars like Faf du Plessis to come out for eight matches, it shouldn’t hesitate over making the BBL too financially appealing for Australian Test stars to ignore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pay them 60 grand a game out of the marketing pool,” said O’Keefe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It might seem obscene, two hundred grand for a couple of games. But it’s not really. Last year in <b>Covid</b>, they (CA) hired a private jet to fly over eight English players and didn’t even sweat over it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Faf du Plessis is essentially on 50k a game, so it’s not crazy money to pay for David Warner at all when he’s a guy who will put an extra 10-15,000 bums on seats.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DRAFT TIPS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O’Keefe says he can’t speak for the Sydney Sixers and their strategy for next Sunday’s August 28 draft, but in his opinion retaining Englishman James Vince should be the priority along with signing a death bowler like Chris Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cross-town rivals Sydney Thunder have a big decision to make over whether to retain English opener Alex Hales when he’s only going to be available for the first part of the tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If I’m thinking about that team, I’m finding it hard to go past Hales because I’m thinking, if I have to come up against them, he’s the one that can take the game away from us the most,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O’Keefe says Melbourne Renegades who hold the No.1 draft pick, desperately need multi-dimensional all-rounders, like Mohammad Nabi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BBL star’s drastic solution to international exodus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Bash draft king Rashid Khan says the competition should be cut in half to stop global stars from staging a mid-season exodus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> is facing the prospect that every single platinum player announced on Monday for the overseas draft on August 28 could be confirming they’re only staying for the first part of the tournament before jetting out to take up more lucrative offers from the UAE and South Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the most the BBL might get one platinum star committing for the entire seven-week season – not an unexpected result – but one that showcases the extreme battle the BBL faces to keep big name internationals in <b>Australia</b> when the cash being offered abroad is so astronomical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watch The Hundred. Every Match Live &amp; Exclusive to Fox Sports on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now &gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afghan leg-spinning superstar Rashid, who will himself only stay in the BBL for 8-10 games before heading to the UAE, insists the mass exit is not all about money and called on CA bosses to slash the current seven-week duration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the shorter it is the best it will be,” Rashid told <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you go around the world to all the leagues (with the exception of the IPL), they’re not that long and it takes 25-30 days where the league just finishes up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Definitely in future as a player, you always want to start the competition and you want to finish that competition. I’m not a fan of leaving the team in the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year as well, I was there in <b>Australia</b> for 75 days but I still missed the last three or four games to play (due to national duty).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ … I think the shorter the league, the maximum amount of the players will be available to play the full competition.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rashid is almost without question the No. 1 player in the inaugural BBL draft, but appears certain to be retained by the Adelaide Strikers, where he was born as a global T20 star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 23-year-old feels enormous loyalty and gratitude to the BBL as one of the leagues that launched his extraordinary career, and has declared that despite the exploding competition around the world, the Bash is still one of the best tournaments there is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for CA is maintaining that status in a fiercely competitive T20 market where the biggest chequebook invariably wins – and length of season must be addressed when the next TV rights broadcast deal is signed in two year‘s’ time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I always enjoyed playing Big Bash. It’s one of the top three. (In terms of) leagues you enjoy the most and the competition is pretty hard,” said Rashid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Toughest cricket there and it makes you mentally (stronger) and skills wise better and better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(But) I think a month (long season) is something which does allow you to have the maximum amount of the best players playing the whole competition.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teams must take at least one platinum ($340,000) or gold ($260,000) level player in the draft, and financially there is no reason why clubs shouldn’t take someone from the top shelf given CA is propping up the $80,000 difference between gold and platinum contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there is talk that the Perth Scorchers may decline to sign a platinum player because they will want someone available for the entire BBL season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s unclear how many gold level players will be available for the full duration, but a team like the Scorchers may prefer to sacrifice on international quality for a tradesman who will commit for the full seven weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That defeats the purpose of what the draft was created for – with CA and broadcasters determined to inject genuine star power into the early weeks of the BBL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other clubs like the Brisbane Heat are likely to take a different view though, and feel that if a superstar like Faf du Plessis, Liam Livingstone or Keiron Pollard can win them a few games early in the season, then it will be worth the investment, before their places are hopefully taken by returning Australian Test stars for the second half of the tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s possible the Melbourne Renegades might look to take Rashid Khan as the No. 1 pick and at least force Adelaide to match the offer – because it’s essentially a free hit. The Renegades would then get the next pick anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rashid has already been in dialogue with Strikers coach Jason Gillespie and expects to be in Adelaide again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did have the chat and definitely, I’m not thinking about any other team to be playing for. I’m more than 100 per cent sure I’ll be able to play for the Strikers,” said Rashid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UGLY BIG BASH FEUD AVERTED, BUT MORE TROUBLE INCOMING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> looks set to broker a peace deal with Chris Lynn, while Steve Smith will be given until the 11th hour to play BBL despite declining to sign with the Sydney Sixers now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say Lynn could play more than half of the Big Bash season with the Adelaide Strikers before leaving to take up a big money deal in the new T20 league in the UAE with CA’s blessing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pragmatic compromise being worked towards by CA boss Nick Hockley would save the game from the prospect of an ugly legal showdown with Lynn who might have been motivated to challenge any move to block him from going to the UAE as a restraint of trade in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watch The Hundred. Every Match Live &amp; Exclusive to Fox Sports on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now &gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not a perfect result to have the BBL’s greatest ever run-scorer walking out on the competition mid-season, but it beats the alternative of him not playing any part in the summer at all after he was dumped by the Brisbane Heat earlier in the year and unveiled as a signing by the UAE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing has been finalised with Lynn but there is confidence a deal can be agreed upon which gives Lynn and CA enough of what they’re both after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worry would be that the compromise with Lynn could set a dangerous precedent for future Australian stars eyeing big money from Dubai and feeling they can have their cake and eat it too, but the Queenslander is a unique case as a 32-year-old veteran with no local contract tying him down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> is making inroads on improving the Big Bash by taking a horses for courses approach to handling each individual case – with a landmark offer to David Warner to play in the BBL with the Sydney Thunder instead of heading to the UAE the prime example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another complex case has emerged in Steve Smith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sydney Sixers were hoping to lock Smith away now, but the batting great has told club powerbrokers he is unsure about whether he will need a rest at that time and therefore doesn’t want to take up a roster spot which could go to a player committed to the entire season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is also the question of whether Smith ought to be entitled to a CA topped up contract like Warner, rather than simply accepting an average deal included in the salary cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not the Sixers choose to keep a roster spot upon for Smith in the hope he changes his mind come the end of the Test summer will depend on how they perform in the upcoming BBL draft on August 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the club feels they have all bases covered in the batting department, the club may decide to move on and fill that 18th roster spot with a younger domestic talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, even if the Sixers fill up all their spots, CA is vowing to also show its pragmatism with Smith and not lock him out should he change his mind and fancy a few BBL games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer Smith was controversially blocked from signing with the Sixers, because rival clubs felt he should have gone into a pool which would have made him available for all teams to have an equal crack at.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">bbl runs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there would be no repeat of that this summer, and sources say the BBL would find a way to help the Sixers get Smith onto their books as a replacement player if he does change his mind late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s understood Warner also expressed concerns to the Sydney Thunder about taking an opportunity that could go to a younger player but was assured they had the space in their cap – and a void in the XI – after losing Usman Khawaja in the off-season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an acceptance that fast bowling stars Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood won’t play BBL due to the workload of the Test summer and the fact a massive Test tour of India will immediately follow in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> is determined to convince all other Australian Test stars to play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marnus Labuschagne joined Khawaja in signing on with the Brisbane Heat on Thursday, but losing Smith from the competition would be a huge blow.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we weren’t talking about when we were talking about Scott Morrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are 13 weeks into the new Labor government and possibly the longest winter ever but for the past week the spotlight has been firmly back on the man who lost his job as Prime Minister back in autumn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health, education, national security, the economy all fell off the agenda as the revelation that Scott Morrison had secretly appointed himself to ministries during the <b>pandemic</b> - first published in The Australian - became the only story in town. Anthony Albanese called a press conference and told us even more about cabinet jobs that the Prime Minister was doing, even though those jobs already had ministers in charge of them and those ministers didn’t know they had company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all raised serious questions. Morrison’s decision to keep Australians in the dark has certainly come under intense scrutiny. Albanese is seeking legal advice. Ex-cabinet colleagues came out for and against their former PM. He called his own press conference. He apologised. A thousand memes bloomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on it raged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, pensioners paid more for their GP appointments. China expanded further into the pacific. The Voice to Parliament is in a holding pattern. Real wages are plummeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let’s take a closer look at what we weren’t talking about when we were talking about Scott Morrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of bulk billing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Universal</span> free healthcare in <b>Australia</b> is crumbling and there are fears the days of bulk-billing are numbered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revelations that patients are struggling to access bulk billing by The Australian's health editor Natasha Robinson were pursued by every news outlet, and The Oz reported young people, particularly those with <b>mental health</b> issues, could bear the brunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health Minister Mark Butler is refusing to commit to raising the diminished Medicare rebate ­despite patient gap fees being at a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor government, the party was responsible for the introduction of Medicare's predecessor Medibank, is facing the collapse of one of its most proud institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month the government increased the Medicare rebate by 1.6%, but it doesn't go far enough to cover the cost of medical appointments when the inflation rate is sitting at 6.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our uninhabitable rentals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian rental homes are colder and damper than is considered safe by the <span class="companylink">World Health Organisation</span>, with homes in NSW so humid they're the perfect environment for mould growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WHO considers 18C as a “safe and well-balanced indoor temperature to protect the health of general populations during cold seasons” in colder climates, but researchers found Aussie rental homes were routinely colder than this. Properties in NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT were particularly chilly, recording temperatures under 18C more than 80% of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prepare to welcome back our overseas friends</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>'s unemployment levels have reached new lows, and as a result youth unemployment fell by nearly a percentage point to 7%, its lowest level since the <span class="companylink">Australian Bureau of Statistics</span> began measuring it in 1978.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is now considering the merits of increasing the migration intake to between 180,000 and 200,000 a year ahead of the October 25 budget to help plug labour shortages across the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've reported here on how Gen Z will be in pole position for the rest of their careers, but that could quickly change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How we'll get to our climate goals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrations were jubilant when Parliament passed the 43% emission reduction target. But now the other shoe drops. Reaching the climate goals <b>Australia</b> voted for at the last election won't come through renewable energy alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the country is going to reach its emission reduction target of 43% by 2020, we will need to trim emissions from areas such as transport and agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our new government wants to expand the existing safeguard mechanism, which essentially sets a limit for how much <b>Australia</b>'s biggest emissions companies can emit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It released a report about this issue on Thursday and wants to get feedback from industry about how it can effectively design a system that will reduce emissions without affecting economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This consultation process will run until the end of September and any changes will apply from July next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still no payrise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wages are going up a smidge, but not enough to keep up with the rising cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official measure of wages rose 0.7% in the June quarter and 2.6% over the past year. But this basically means the amount you're taking home each pay day has dropped, slumping to 3.5% over the year to June when considering inflation is at 6.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists generally expect it will take the best part of two years for wage growth to exceed the rising cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life for the first Australians</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun consulting with Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities about what an Indigenous voice to parliament might look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He travelled to the Torres Strait with Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney and Queensland senator Nita Green this week to begin those discussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Linda Burney
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed question that Australians might be asked at a referendum is:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"Do you support an alteration to the constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice?\"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull revealed he had changed his mind about the voice, saying he backs Albanese's proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He rejected the notion when he was in power but now says the idea should be supported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albanese this week also said his government would prioritise lifting the employment rate of Indigenous Australians ahead of his Jobs and Skills summit next month, arguing First Nations Australians should not be left behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's real out there</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our neighbours - the Solomon Islands - are going ahead with a $100m deal with Chinese telecommunications giant <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> to build 161 mobile phone towers across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is despite a report warning the project might pose substantial financial risks for the island nation and comes as Beijing seeks to expand its footprint in the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Solomons signed a security pact with China in April, which opened the way for Beijing to send police and military forces to the region in a move that particularly worried Australian officials due to the Pacific island's proximity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has become very close to The Solomons in recent years, handing over $730 million in September 2019 after the island nation switched its allegiance from Taiwan to Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in the land of <span class="companylink">Questacon</span>, roundabouts and politicians, Russia has been blocked from building its planned new embassy on a prime piece of Canberra real estate that strategists say would have become the Kremlin’s new spy HQ in <b>Australia</b>.</p>

</div><div class="author">JILL ROWBOTHAM, LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, EXCLUSIVE </div><div>624 words</div><div>19 August 2022</div><div>The Australian</div><div>AUSTLN</div><div>Australian2</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case clearance rates have dramatically lifted following the merger last September of the Family Court of <b>Australia</b> and the Federal Circuit Court of <b>Australia</b>, with those finalised at a record 130 per cent in the year to June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improved resources and systems enabled judges to make inroads into the notorious backlog that had decreased by 18 per cent, or more than 3800 matters since the merger, Federal Circuit and Family Court of <b>Australia</b> Chief Justice Will Alstergren told the ­national family law conference in Adelaide this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Registrars have conducted more than 4100 dispute resolution events mainly in parenting cases since September 1, 2021, with an average settlement rate of 55 per cent, including a large proportion of entrenched matters that had been pending in the system for years,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court has received a boost in funding in recent years, including a record $100m allocation in the May 2021 federal budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling its progress a “rejuvenation”, the Chief Justice said: “Some of this started in late 2018, some was in response to the <b>pandemic</b> and some was as a result of legislative change.” The <b>pandemic</b> had been instrumental in speeding up implementation of online operations of the courts including case management. Among other benefits, this had “enabled vulnerable and regional litigants to have access to justice from their homes or safe environments” rather than having to go to court registries or wait for a judge to come on circuit court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The courts now have 111 judges, up by 52 since October 2018; 110 registrars, almost trebled since 2019; and 106 child court experts, up by 38 per cent since June 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined docket size for judges in division 2 of the court, where most parenting and property orders are made, had fallen by 60 per cent since the merger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Contravention List introduced in October was successfully dealing with complaints about compliance and helping to identify whether there was increasing risk to participants or their children during the time it took for a case to be finalised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two pilot programs were proving successful: the Priority Property Pools under $500,000 (PPP500) list, piloted in four capital cities, with 77 per cent of cases settled by registrars and fewer than 5 per cent requiring a significant hearing before a judge; and the Lighthouse Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter is a more streamlined process for screening cases for ­violence and other risk factors, then triaging and managing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was promised $54.9m in last year’s budget, and the court hopes to roll it out nationally this year Chief Justice Alstergren also revealed new data gathered since the October 2020 launch of the revised system for collecting Notice of Child Abuse, Family Violence or Risk forms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It showed almost 80 per cent of parenting cases filed last financial year were referred to the state or territory child welfare agency because of the risks alleged; in almost 70 per cent, one or both parents alleged child abuse or the risk of it; and in 58 per cent, one or more of the parents said <b>mental health</b> issues experienced by the other had harmed or risked harming a child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These figures are shocking and go some way to depicting the prevalence of family violence and other risks in our courts and in the community,” Chief Justice Alstergren said, calling for “a proper ­national conversation”. “It is ... time that far more was done about family violence in our society,” he said. “Not just about how we as courts and the [legal] profession treat cases with family violence and how to keep people safe once it has occurred, but how to prevent it.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighteen months after closing a $670,000 equity crowd-funding round, vegan cheese maker Hello Friend Foods has run out of money and is seeking a buyer or partner, with the company blaming ongoing Melbourne lockdowns and manufacturing struggles for its financial situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company co-founder Bree Gaudette wrote a letter to Hello Friend Foods’ 569 financial backers this month telling them that her company is set to run out of funds within the next 60 days, in an email she “never wanted nor expected to have to write.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was valued at $4m when it raised $672,002 in November 2020, with crowd-funding backers offered T-shirts, tote bags and discounts to the company’s online store as well as shares in the company in exchange for their investment, with some pouring in thousands of dollars at $1 per share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowd-funding documents seen by The Australian show that the company turned a net profit of $39,417 for the year ending June 30, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hello Friend Foods offered what it described as a “revolution on plant-based cheese”, with products including a mozzarella-style cheese, a halloumi-style cheese, and a vegan ‘cheese’ sauce available both from bricks and mortar retailers as well as the company’s online store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After a supremely challenging few years, Hello Friend Foods cannot continue to trade in its current state,” Ms Gaudette wrote in a letter to shareholders, seen by The Australian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re now actively seeking buyers and/or partners who are mission aligned and who can take Hello Friend into the spaces it deserves to be. Ideally, we would love to see Hello Friend flourish into the global brand that we know it can be, led by a larger team who has established international relationships and the required production infrastructure,” Ms Gaudette continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Worst case scenario, barring a sale or partnership, we will begin steps to winding up before we become insolvent, which would be in the next 60 days. If that happens, after selling our assets and paying any debts, any remaining funds would be divided among all shareholders pro-rata.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company’s exact current financial situation is unclear. Ms Gaudette said that ongoing lockdowns in Melbourne and <b>Australia</b> resulted in the company losing two-thirds of its revenue virtually overnight, while the company was also impacted by the closure of a third-party manufacturing facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were successful in acquiring our place in <span class="companylink">Woolworths</span>, which was a huge win and very exciting. But unfortunately we were forced to delay that launch indefinitely until we could secure contract manufacturing,” she wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even with this mammoth effort from our team to increase revenue, we have forecasted that we will not be able to meet the sales targets required to sustain us while we find and negotiate with a new contract manufacturer to produce our products at scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s also worth mentioning here that along with most other Victorians during the <b>pandemic</b>, the <b>mental health</b> of our team suffered greatly. We were (and still are) trying our very best to lock in distributors, secure new accounts, and reach profitability while navigating rising prices and limited availability of ingredients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On a personal note, I feel deep disappointment in this outcome. We faced all these challenges head on and with such tenacity, which makes this hurt even more. Having said that, I’m focusing on the positive possibility of a sale or partnership which would see Hello Friend grow.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Gaudette told The Australian that she has begun discussions with interested parties and the feedback has been positive so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re also still open to offers,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One anonymous investor told The Australian they wished they had known more about crowd-funding before investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you see a product or idea you believe in, it’s easy to get caught up in the hype. I follow a plant-based diet and was keen to see more Australian made, non-dairy cheeses on the market. I wanted to be a part of that and support some young Australians giving it a go,” they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve since read more about equity crowd-funding and realised its pitfalls. It’s rare for investors to receive any form of return and the reporting requirements are pretty minimal, so investors can’t expect much transparency from the company they have invested in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In hindsight, donating the money to an animal welfare not-for-profit or threatened species recovery program would have been a wiser choice for me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Vitale, co-founder of crowd-funding platform Birchal, said he could not comment on Hello Friend Foods specifically but that investing in early-stage businesses is speculative and carries high risks for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sadly, but unsurprisingly, some companies will fail, and investors will lose their investment,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<b>Australia</b>’s crowd sourced funding industry is still relatively nascent, so expectations around returns on investment need to be tempered with the medium to long term investment horizon for crowd sourced funded businesses. So far one company has graduated from CSF to the ASX, and many others have reported material growth in revenue and valuations from follow-on rounds inside and outside the CSF regime,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anyone considering investing in an early stage business should be aware of this before investing, and should seek independent financial advice before investing if they are unsure.”</p>

                        </span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like lettuce and broccoli, health insurance premiums risk outpacing the rate of inflation in coming years unless <b>Australia</b>’s private health system accelerates a raft of reforms aimed at making care more affordable, <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> warns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>’s biggest health insurer, valued at $9.78bn, has so far stripped out about $115m in costs from its business in the past five years and is targeting another $35m in savings as part of its efforts to keep premiums low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But chief executive David Koczkar says the entire sector – insurers, hospitals and doctors – needed to become more united to prevent steep premium hikes and return to thousands of Australians withdrawing from private healthcare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The ask of the industry is more than any one business can deliver,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The known issues in health can no longer be ignored; our health system is fatigued, and the pace of change is not keeping up with our growing health needs. We are at a critical juncture as we emerge from the <b>pandemic</b> and it’s widely recognised that we all need to move with greater urgency.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australians have become used to low health insurance premium rises – or none at all in the <b>pandemic</b> after many insurers froze price hikes – in recent years, with the rate hovering around 3 per cent. This compared with an average premium rise of 5.59 per cent in 2016, which was more than four times the rate of inflation that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher premium increases triggered an exodus from health insurance, mainly among younger Australians, before the <b>pandemic</b> to the point former <span class="companylink">Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority</span> executive Geoff Summerhayes warned only three private health insurers would have a sustainable business model by this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prediction did not eventuate as <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> sparked a renewed focus on health and wellbeing and more Australians signed up to private health insurance to dodge lengthy public waiting lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Medibank</span>, it signed on almost 61,000 policyholders in the year to June 30 – a 3.2 per cent increase on the previous year – and recorded its highest customer retention in a decade. Meanwhile, health insurance profit jumped 10 per cent to $592.6m and revenue firmed 2.7 per cent to $6.86bn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts have warned the sugar hit may not last, and Mr Koczkar said the industry needed to act swiftly on implementing a series of reforms to maintain that trend and stave off 2016-style premium hikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Prostheses is a prime example of how difficult it is to deliver real change to our health system. Despite all the vested interests, there is an agreement from all parties that Australians should no longer pay some of the highest prices in the world for medical devices,” Mr Koczkar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But the devil remains in the detail, and while government remains committed to this reform, vested interests remain. To ensure we can keep premium increases low, we need to maintain a commitment to the process, and a commitment to move with pace.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people in private healthcare also means less people in the public system, which Mr Koczkar said is showing signs of significant stress amid ambulance ramping; growing emergency department and elective surgery waiting times, and difficulty accessing <b>mental health</b> care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a nation, we are grappling with how we sustain the quality of life we expect, in a challenging economic environment. We need a health system that is fit for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But health is lagging other industries in productivity – with the health sector below the national average</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“More patients are needing treatment, and our ageing population is increasingly presenting to hospital with complex comorbidities, with around 1 in 2 Australian adults have at least one chronic health condition. The public system’s ability to meet this growing demand is diminishing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramsay also recognises this and has launched its own ‘hospital in the home’ service to increase affordability but sourcing funding from health insurers is patchy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Koczkar supports such alternative care models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a nation we only invest around 1 per cent of our budget on prevention. <b>Australia</b> also remains one of the slowest adopters in the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> of new care settings – that offer more patient choice, minimise unnecessary time in hospital and reduce out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We helped one in four <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> customers undergoing a joint replacement to have their rehab at home (this year). We also delivered around 3.5 million virtual health interactions to our customers and the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This year we also continued to grow our investments in health and we more than doubled our no gap network, with 64 per cent of <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> customers to live within 25km of a no gap site by October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, <span class="companylink">Medibank</span>’s group profit fell 10.7 per cent, after volatility in financial markets tipped its investment portfolio into a $24.8m loss compared with a $120m gain last year. Total claims increased 1.9 per cent to $5.7bn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst Scott Russell maintained his buy rating for the company with a $3.90 price target, citing “favourable margin trends continuing post <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“FY23 guidance and commentary is upbeat, with ongoing policy growth (+2.7 per cent) and low claims inflation (2.3 per cent). Headline EPS came in 4 per cent below consensus due to adverse investment experience. Adjusting for this, underlying EPS was 1 per cent ahead and group operating profit 4 per cent ahead,” Mr Russell wrote in a note to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> also returned $682m in so-called ‘<b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> savings’ to members which includes a seven month deferral of premium increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> will pay a final dividend of 7.3c a share on September 8, taking the total for the 2022 financial year to 13.4c. That’s up 5.5 per cent from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> shares closed 0.9 per cent higher at $3.55 on Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smartphones can play a vital role in societal connection but they can also harm <b>mental wellbeing</b> for young Aussies In recent weeks, we’ve learned two troubling facts about young Australians – the prevalence of mental disorders has hit a new high and the rate of volunteering has plumbed a new low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the surveys, young Australians are more likely to be experiencing anxiety or ­depression. At the same time, this cohort is less likely to be joining with others to help their local community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With charities in desperate need of new helpers, many are pulling back from the civic work that is so vital to a strong society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a sense of the scale of the problem, let’s look at the numbers. Among young women, an extraordinary 47 per cent have experienced a mental disorder in the previous year – up from 30 per cent in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among young men, the rate of mental disorders has grown from 23 per cent to 31 per cent. Among young people, rates of depression have doubled, rates of social ­phobia have tripled and rates of panic disorder have increased nearly four-fold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of community ­involvement among 18- to 24-year-olds, the volunteering rate is now 25 per cent, down from 30 per cent in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many remarkable young Australians still give their time and energy to help out in their local community but the net effect is that for every five young volunteers today, we would have had six young volunteers if the rate had remained as high as in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s going on? One possibility is that young people are merely reflecting changes in ­society at large. Over the past few decades, Australians of all ages have become less likely to join organised groups, play team sports or socialise with our neighbours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is that these changes are reflecting the impact of <b>Covid</b> on communities. From churches to political parties, many organisations have struggled to keep their members engaged in recent times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the <b>pandemic</b> hit many in Gen Z at a time when they were leaving school or looking for their first job, it might not be surprising that it affected their <b>mental wellbeing</b> and shaped their community engagement. The trouble with both these ­explanations is that they don’t fit the data very well. The rise in mental ­disorders and decline in community preceded <b>Covid</b> and are more pronounced among young people than older generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In The Coddling Of The American Mind, Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt offer a different explanation – smartphones and social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they point out, the rise of these technologies and platforms occurred rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iPhone was released in 2007. The first commercial Android touchscreen phones launched in 2008. Key social media platforms had their genesis around this period, including <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> (publicly launched in 2006), <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> (founded 2006), Tumblr (2007), WhatsApp (2009), ­<span class="companylink">Instagram</span> (2010), <span class="companylink">Snapchat</span> (2010) and <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span> (2010).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These technologies have created extraordinary connections but they have also reshaped society and ­nowhere more than among the generation dubbed ‘iGen’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American teens are less likely than young people in previous generations to leave the house without their ­parents. The share who get together with friends nearly every day has ­fallen by two-fifths over the past two decades. They spend more time on devices than socialising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the US, as in <b>Australia</b>, the rise of mental disorders has been most pronounced among girls. Lukianoff and Haidt argue this is because boys tend to be physically aggressive (they punch and shove) while girls are more relationally aggressive (they try to hurt rivals’ social standing).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further evidence of the connection between devices and <b>mental wellbeing</b> comes from an experiment involving 2743 people that paid half its subjects to quit <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> for a month. Compared with the control group, those who went off <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> spent more time socialising with friends and family, were significantly less anxious or depressed and were happier with their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These findings are a reminder that the supercomputers in our pockets are not an unalloyed good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smartphones and social media can help connect communities but they can also fragment society and ­decrease face-to-face interactions. In the case of social media, part of the answer may lie in what Nick Terrell and I describe in our book Reconnected as ‘CyberConnecting’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Becoming better smartphone users involves recognising the addictive qualities – from SnapStreaks to ping notifications – that make devices so engaging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like salt and sugar in junk foods, many of the functions of smartphones are designed to keep us hooked rather than to serve our deeper needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CyberConnecting also involves seeking out platforms that foster community. When natural disasters strike, <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>’s Open Homes platform allows people to offer their spare room to someone who needs emergency accommodation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s Impact Challenge funds social entrepreneurs to build technology platforms that connect communities and serve a social purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mobile apps that allow people to text their friends about politics provide a level of personal engagement that no ad campaign can match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great things about being a parliamentarian is the chance to regularly speak with school and university students. I’ll almost invariably come away from these conversations feeling optimistic and energised. But we need to recognise the scale of the challenge that young Australians are facing today and provide them with the skills and tools to ensure that smartphones serve us – not the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only by getting smarter about smartphone use can we ensure that Australian teens are happier, health­ier and more connected with the community. Andrew Leigh is the Federal Assistant Minister for Charities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trust the experts, journalists say – ignoring the fact that experts often disagree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polarised media have worked out which experts to quote to reinforce the political positioning of different news businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ABC and Guardian <b>Australia</b> often quote members of the OzSAGE group, that describes itself as “a multidisciplinary network of Australian experts from a broad range of sectors relevant to the wellbeing of the Australian population during and after the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>”. It advocates for stronger public health mandates, popular among leftwing journalists for whom resilience is not a virtue and no spending by governments is ever enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why wouldn’t Australians, almost 10 million of whom have now had <b>Covid</b> and recovered quickly, not be sceptical of calls for increasing mask mandates or getting vaccine boosters? The messaging around both has been misleading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australians should have been told earlier that vaccination does not prevent infection. They need more exposure to the truth about the side effects of vaccines. This column reported heart disease side effects of mRNA vaccines last July, but this has not received the same level of publicity that the rare side effects of <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca</span> did earlier last year, largely because AZ became a symbol for journalists and doctors campaigning against the former Coalition government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australians should have been told that mask-wearing may be wise in some places but that masks are not a barrier to viruses. Governments need to admit they got a lot wrong in the first two years of the <b>pandemic</b> when people were locked down – golf, fishing and swimming were deemed too dangerous and people were arrested for sitting in public parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some journalists have recently been breathlessly reporting <b>Australia</b> now has the world’s highest <b>Covid</b> mortality rate. Of course <b>Covid</b> case numbers and deaths have risen in our winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 12,600 have died with the virus. Yet our death rate per million people last week sat at 484 since early 2020, compared with more than 3000 in the US and over 2500 in much of Europe. Even <b>New Zealand</b>, <b>lockdown</b> capital of the world, has a higher death rate than <b>Australia</b>, at 489.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Nick Coatsworth, infectious diseases specialist, told ABC radio’s The World Today on Wednesday that our recent higher death rates were because we kept the virus out, with closed borders, for two years. “But unfortunately what that meant is our susceptible population, which is elderly Australians, were not exposed to the virus … so our death rates stayed down. When Omicron … moved through the community those individuals who were susceptible, sadly many of them lost their lives.” Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at <span class="companylink">Deakin University</span> in Melbourne, said death rates needed to be understood in a wider context. The age standardised death rate in <b>Australia</b> had fallen in 2020 and 2021 compared with pre-<b>pandemic</b> years because lockdowns and closed borders kept influenza and seasonal colds to a minimum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Absolutely we need to understand if there are preventable deaths,” she said. “We need to make sure public health messaging ensures people understand the importance of early testing and treatment pathway options, like antivirals. But it is true that with infection, community wide the most vulnerable people sadly will be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yet, compared with most other countries, we did save 20,000 lives in the first two years of the <b>pandemic</b> and extended life for some beyond what would have been expected. Some of what we are seeing now are some delayed deaths, and we need to examine death rates over a three or four-year window.” Discussing whether people with comorbidities were dying of <b>Covid</b> or with <b>Covid</b>, Coatsworth said that for many people with a life-threatening illness, the eventual cause of death long before <b>Covid</b> came along was always infection. If not <b>Covid</b>, it would have been flu, norovirus or the common cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting on media calls for the return of health mandates, Coatsworth told this column: “I wonder whether the ABC, the Nine papers and the Guardian’s health reporters would have a story to tell without the medical experts behind them. The question becomes what is driving the medical groupthink of the influential medical group OzSAGE.” OzSAGE members have the ear of many senior journalists, particularly ABC health editor Norman Swan. Many journalists have been calling for a return of mask mandates and big public spending on ventilation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Said Coatsworth: “Some experts have led us down a path to disunity among medical professionals and uncertainty in the general community. The reason is the people who should be constructing the unified narrative, the chief health officers, have not been getting in front of some of these debates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Paul Kelly (federal CMO) tried to get in front of the narrative in January when he said we should not be looking at deaths but at excess deaths. In response to that, Norman Swan and the OzSAGE group absolutely pilloried him. Every time the CMOs try to get in front of the narrative these guys come out and misrepresent the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First it was <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca</span> which they criticised at a time we should have been making sure it was getting to older Australians. Then they moved to Omicron and instead of reassuring Australians it was a milder variant they moved on to the debate about schools when we should have been entirely focused on aged care, boosters and infection control in aged centres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We probably had higher death rates because we were not focused where we should have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now as Omicron is receding we should be gathering evidence on which interventions actually work – what is the evidence for masks in schools or spending $4.3bn on what these guys call the ‘ventilation revolution’. They have co-opted the left side of politics including the ABC and the Guardian to the idea of a health-economy divide. It’s a false dichotomy because it’s not just about money but about wellbeing, people’s <b>mental health</b> and their human rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the OzSAGE crew believe their interventions have a neutral effect. They are starting from an ideologically motivated position – disease control at any cost. Plus the idea that anyone with a dissenting view in the scientific community is tarnished as a neoliberal even though most would be centre left.” Coatsworth and Bennett pointed to the negative effect of social media on public health advocacy. Coatsworth wrote last year: “<span class="companylink">Twitter</span> is the graveyard of nuance, the assassin of good public policy and the enemy of consensus.’’ He was “troubled by the behaviour of some practitioners on social media during the <b>pandemic</b>”. He singled out the <span class="companylink">Burnet Institute</span> – Burnet is an ABC favourite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The <span class="companylink">Burnet Institute</span> is the perfect example of what we don’t want in a possible Australian version of the US Centres for Disease Control. Either there are sensible voices in that institute who are suppressed by the leadership or they are just subject to an incredible amount of group think. This is a problem because much of the public health firepower that has been going to support Victorian CHO Brett Sutton has come from Burnet.” Coatsworth and Bennett believe society needs to be more honest about death and the cost of marginal increases in life expectancy. “The OzSAGE insistence that all deaths are equal and a tragedy and that any other position is ageist is an immature position that very few practitioners share. Most of us realise quality of life is more important than longevity, whether one is talking about deaths from <b>Covid</b> or any other cause,” Coatsworth said.</p>

</div><div class="author">Dr Danielle McMullen </div><div>905 words</div><div>15 August 2022</div><div>07:00</div><div>Daily Telegraph​ - ​Online</div><div>NLDLTW</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wound Awareness Week comes once a year, but as a GP I see the impact wounds have every day of the year on affected patients — the impact on their health and quality of life: constant pain, social <b>isolation</b>, sleep and mobility problems, and <b>mental health</b> issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If not treated properly, wounds can be life threatening, requiring treatment for severe infections and in some cases, amputation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chronic wounds affect around half a million Australians at any given time and cost the health system an estimated $3 billion each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This represents about two per cent of our national healthcare expenditure and is likely to be an underestimate due to the lack of reliable data in <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is significant, and the burden will only get worse as <b>Australia</b>’s population continues to grow, age, and develop more complex and chronic conditions. Yet, chronic wounds continue to be an unrecognised and underfunded public health issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of these wounds are managed in the community, with general practices playing a key role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those of us who treat these wounds know that best-practice care with best-practice wound dressings and products is essential to reducing this significant burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this care is expensive and time consuming, and many of the patients we treat with chronic wounds are often older Australians, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, or patients with other chronic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are vulnerable patients who are often on limited incomes due to their stage of life or reduced capacity to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where possible, we minimise the out-of-pocket costs for these patients but under current Medicare rules, GPs are unable to bulk-bill a patient for the consultation and charge just the cost of the dressing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we must decide whether to bulk-bill the patient and absorb the cost of the dressing — with the entire service often performed at a financial loss — or charge the patient for both the consultation and the dressing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We shouldn’t have to make this choice, but after years of frozen and inadequate Medicare rebates, GPs are just not in a position to subsidise these costs. Patient care suffers as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, patients buy their dressings and other consumables at market rates from a pharmacy, just so the GP treating the wound can bulk-bill them for the consultation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients can live with these wounds for months or even years, so the costs add up. Patients could be paying up to $340 a month, or nearly $4000 a year, in out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The redback spider bite costing young mum $1300 a week</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a patient cannot afford these high costs, they often skip dressing changes or choose cheaper suboptimal dressings, and their wound takes even longer to heal — it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle. But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AMA’s new report Solutions to the chronic wound problem in <b>Australia</b> offers answers, proposing a five-point plan to improve patient access to best-practice wound care through their general practitioner, and to give patients’ wounds the best chance to heal. If implemented, the plan would provide patients with diabetic foot ulcers, arterial leg ulcers, and venous leg ulcers access to subsidised wound dressings through their general practice, and a more co-ordinated approach to evidence-based care led by the GP through the introduction of new MBS items — an estimated government investment of $23.4 million over the next four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AMA is not alone in its call for better wound care for Australians with chronic wounds. Many other health organisations are also calling for action on this hidden epidemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solutions proposed by the AMA build on the recommendations outlined by the MBS Review Taskforce Wound Management Working Group, many of which have still not been implemented by government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We anticipate the AMA’s solutions will free up GP time and reduce the strain on other healthcare settings including hospitals and outpatient clinics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With <b>Australia</b> now facing a serious GP workforce shortage and a hospital crisis, these solutions can support general practices to deliver more care to their communities and reduce the strain on other parts of our health system which are struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the AMA’s analysis indicates, receiving care through general practice is (overall) cheaper than receiving care through an outpatient hospital clinic or other community healthcare setting. The proposed solutions will save the government money — an estimated $203.4 million over the next four years. This is huge return on investment — $8.68 for every $1 invested, and the return will only increase as more patients receive care through their general practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous government acknowledged that general practices should not have to wear the cost of consumables and there should be “alternative sources of government support”, however a funded wound consumables scheme is yet to be implemented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new government now has an opportunity to act on this and increase access to affordable wound care and improve the lives of those living with chronic wounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution we have proposed will not only improve patient outcomes but will also save money in the long run. The government should choose to heal the wounds caused by this hidden epidemic.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>AUSTRALIA</b> has made significant strides forward in recent decades to increase both community awareness of <b>mental health</b> issues and the resourcing and expertise to address the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, for all that has been done it is clear that as a society we’re still at the foot of a mountain to truly combating this escalating crisis of our times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tragic death of former NRL premiership coach Paul Green three days ago shocked the nation and has raised many confounding and complex questions – some which may never be answered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green was a highly successful, highly intelligent, loving husband and father and a man who had reached the heights of sporting glory in the NRL and whose recent work had included developing a wellness app to help the <b>mental health</b> of others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the stark questions is this: How as a community can we reach people who present as relatively happy (and who may well be high functioning and successful), but are silently suffering under the weight of <b>mental illness</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can we encourage people in the cohorts of society who are less likely to admit distress to get the help they need? No section of society is untouched by the tentacles of <b>mental illness</b> – the turbulent two <b>pandemic</b> years have been particularly difficult for <b>Australia</b>’s youth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grim statistics – which do nothing to tell of the human tragedy behind each number – show how acute the toll of <b>mental illness</b> is for middle-aged men: More than a quarter of the 759 suicides in Queensland in 2020 were men aged 40-59.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say men in tough industries where “old-school male thinking” about not wanting to look weak is prevalent were particularly at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of Green’s death – which occurred a month before his 50th birthday – was felt viscerally by those who personally knew him. Close friends of the father of two have told of having no clue he was in anguish and recounted seemingly regular conversations with him in the final days of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V’landys was spot on when he said tragedy showed how fragile life is and urged people to “take care of each other”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veteran coach Wayne Bennett too made a raw plea for men to be prepared to open up if they were suffering despair: “You have to let us know so we can try to help.” Australian Men’s Health Forum chief executive Glen Poole recommends all workers be alert to suicide danger signs such as colleagues becoming withdrawn or angry, talking about becoming a burden to others or abusing alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Bond University</span> professor and psychotherapist Alan Patching suggests “every workplace” in <b>Australia</b> should have a dedicated <b>mental health</b> first-aid officer to try to combat the suicide scourge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counsellor Chris Smith, who works with major corporations, encourages people to initiate conversations that scratch below the surface by asking friends or workmates the question “Tell me about you?” It’s unspeakably sad that it’s too late to help Green and the burden of this tragedy will remain for all who cherished him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as a community we must do whatever we can to reach others like him and curb this toll of devastating tragedy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I might send Vera to <b>Australia</b>”. Best-selling author Ann Cleeves says her famous detective Vera Stanhope could be coming Down Under, writes Kerry Parnell She’s North East England’s most famous resident, but detective Vera Stanhope, star of 10 novels by author Ann Cleeves and a long-running TV series with Brenda Blethyn, might one day pack her bags and head Down Under.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She might go out for a holiday,” Ann tells The Sunday Telegraph. “I might write a short story.” Ann, 67, is packing her bags for real as she prepares to fly to <b>Australia</b> to promote the tenth Vera Stanhope novel, The Rising Tide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s nice after lockdowns, to be able to get out and meet readers again – and in <b>Australia</b> first, which is a bit special,” Ann says, explaining she has a lot of fans Down Under, who watch the TV series. They won’t be disappointed by the latest murder mystery, which is centred around an ageing group of friends and their reunion on the Island of Lindisfarne, off the Northumberland coast, which turns deadly. She has penned 36 best-selling novels, around her popular detectives Vera Stanhope, Jimmy Perez and Matthew Venn, set in the Shetland Islands, the North East of England and Devon, but Ann says she doesn’t have a plan – the books just evolve naturally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I will carry on with Vera as long as I’ve still got stories to tell,” she says. “I don’t want to repeat myself and I don’t want to bore other people. I alternate — I’m working on the final draft of a new Matthew Venn book and they’re set in North Devon,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But then, there’s a feeling of, “Oh, now I can go home, back to Vera, who I’ve known for such a long time and is so much a part of me.” Of all her detectives, Vera has endured the longest. What is it about the no-nonsense character that resonates so much with people? “She’s a strong woman of a certain age and she absolutely refuses to be patronised,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rising Tide has a nod to MeToo, with the female characters reflecting they probably wouldn’t put up with what they had done in their youth, now. Ann says Vera, like all of us, is changing with the times, even though the first novel came out 23 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann calls Rising Tide her <b>lockdown</b> book, “about older people reflecting on their own mortality,” but <b>lockdown</b> also brought about another literary project, her Reading For Wellbeing initiative, which she co-funds, championing reading for <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was inspired to start it after her late husband suffered <b>mental health</b> problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE RISING TIDE BY ANN CLEEVES, MACMILLAN, $34.99, IS ON SALE NOW.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paid internships for university students to work in schools will be part of radical reforms to teacher training, as education ministers fast-track foreign teachers into classrooms to plug a crippling skills shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Universities with high dropout rates for student teachers will be punished financially, while more maths and literacy lessons will be woven into education degrees to make graduates classroom-ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Education Minister Jason Clare endorsed performance-based pay rises to keep top teachers in classrooms, after a historic meeting with his state and territory counterparts in Canberra on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In unprecedented reforms, ministers agreed to deliver a ­national “action plan’’ by year’s end to reform teacher training and stop the brain drain from schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priority citizenship, work rights and fast-tracked visas for foreign teachers and teaching students were also discussed at the meeting. Ministers vowed to ease workloads and boost teacher pay, after hearing from individual teachers and school principals invited to the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Clare said one teacher’s tale of working 70-hour weeks, and preparing lesson plans after she put her own children to bed, “almost brought me to tears’’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said ministers gave “lots of nods’’ to a Universities <b>Australia</b> plan to transform teaching degrees into an apprentice-based model, combining theory with on-the-job training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said first-year undergraduates should be embedded in classrooms “right off the bat” for practical training, while final-year ­students should be paid to work in schools as interns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s a lot of support for that idea of paid internship,’’ he said. “(It’s about) finally seeing student teachers in the classroom as an asset, rather than as something that just gets in the way, and helps to make sure that young people who are at university know what they’re getting into and that they really want to be there for the right reasons.’’ <span class="companylink">University of Sydney</span> vice-chancellor Mark Scott – who began his career as a schoolteacher and is a former <span class="companylink">NSW Education Department</span> secretary – will lead a panel of experts to shake up initial teacher education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Clare said education ­degrees must focus on how to teach children to read, noting that just 12 per cent of the content of a four-year Bachelor of Education relates to teaching literacy, with 12 per cent on teaching maths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Initial teacher education is screaming out for reform,’’ he said. “We want to make sure that teachers are better prepared for the classroom.’’ Mr Clare said young teachers needed more experienced teachers to “mentor” them. “They need an induction process, they need some hands-on experience about behaviour management,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Clare said half the university students who enrol in an education degree failed to finish, compared to a dropout rate of 30 per cent in other degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What’s going wrong there?’’ he said. “If there are changes we can make so that 60 per cent finish a teaching degree, then we will go a long way to fixing the teacher supply issue.’’ Mr Clare flagged changes to university funding, to funnel federally subsidised places to universities with the highest graduation rate, and stripping places from those with high dropout rates. Ministers also agreed to model teacher training on the hands-on hospital internships for student doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The way unis work with hospitals for medical students is very different to the way that unis work with schools and education departments and teachers,’’ Mr Clare said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There might be some lessons for us there, where we can get better practical outcomes.’’ Mr Clare said ministers wanted more career-change professionals to switch to teaching, but had not discussed whether to halve the requirement for a two-year masters degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Territory Education Minister Eva Lawler, a former teacher and principal, said ministers wanted to see improvements to teacher training. “For too long, we have felt that initial teacher education hasn’t provided us necessarily, as employers, with the set of teachers that we need with the skill sets that we require in our system,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace suggested that teacher quality had flatlined over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve made a lot of changes over the last few years and I don’t know … that we necessarily have a better teacher today than what we had 10 years ago,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell called for foreign teachers to be fast-tracked for citizenship, as an incentive to teach in <b>Australia</b> – a suggestion the other ministers said they were open to supporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Clare said visas for foreign teachers were being prioritised, and suggested that longer work visas be granted to foreign students enrolled in Australian teaching degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Mitchell has appointed professor John Hattie, an expert on ways to improve student learning, to review salaries for high-performing teachers in NSW.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The starting salary for teachers is pretty good but it’s when you go higher up, and the longer you are in the profession, you do hit that ceiling and feel you’ve got to move into a leadership role or perhaps into a department to get more money and more prestige,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tasmanian Education Minister Roger Jaensch said the national plan would put a stop to interstate poaching of teachers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can steal each other’s ideas, share each other’s information, and come out with some real solutions to ensure that we’ve elevated the status of teachers and teaching as a profession in this country,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victorian Education Minister Natalie Hutchins said teachers were suffering from <b>pandemic</b> burnout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Teachers are dealing with issues that they’ve never had to deal with in the past, with increased <b>mental health</b> (issues) on the rise for students,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The education ministers agreed to increase the number of teachers with Highly Accomplished and Lead Teacher certification, with “awards and honours’’, as well as pay, to reward high performers. Federal Opposition education spokesman Alan Tudge said the challenge would be to “deliver concrete action that will improve the education of students and ­reward teacher excellence’’.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New teal independent federal MP Sophie Scamps is calling for a ban on junk-food advertising, suggesting it’s fuelling an obesity epidemic among youth. She is preparing a private member’s bill limiting fast-food advertising and sponsorship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in obesity has become a global problem, especially in wealthy countries, and <b>Australia</b> is no exception. In fact, perhaps surprising given our sporting culture, we are one of the more obese nations among the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> countries, which is why the <span class="companylink">Australian Medical Association</span> supports efforts to reduce the consumption of junk food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scamps, an emergency doctor and former high-performance athlete, is well placed to lead such a campaign and it’s a worthy one. Perhaps she should widen her campaign to the broader community. Obesity is as prevalent among adults, causing physical and <b>mental health</b> problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moves to ban or restrict certain types of advertising is nothing new: think cigarettes and alcohol. But media organisations bristle at such reforms, given their business model is already under threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the parliament will also seek to legislate a sugar tax. Given that wider tax reform urgently is needed, debating the merits of another sin tax, allowing for less efficient taxes to be cut, could be timely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sin taxes aren’t new either. Designed to penalise bad behaviour, in theory they should discourage the use of products deemed harmful to individuals or society in general. So it’s no surprise the <span class="companylink">World Health Organisation</span> supports the taxing of sugary drinks, for example, to help tackle obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics in the Coalition point to a sugar tax as an example of the nanny state taking over. But in the era of <b>Covid</b>, lectures from the Coalition about government going too far in telling us what to do is hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents within Labor point to the regressive nature of many sin taxes, suggesting they penalise the poor without necessarily adjusting behaviour. Many cheaper foods are high in sugar, for example. Yet we already have sin taxes on everything from gambling to smoking and alcohol, regressive taxes one and all, and no government wants to reduce these taxes. In fact, such taxes regularly go up. Taxes on beer recently did. We wait to see what the October budget throws up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of gambling, the tax is built on an industry that theoretically could be banned or substantially curtailed if politicians really wanted to stand on virtue. But prohibition has taught us doing so moves such practices underground, reducing the overall tax take of government at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This logic is why there is a push to properly legalise vaping, a harm-minimisation strategy that is taxable and would undercut underground trading in cigarettes. The same could happen with other drugs, but politicians bristle at the prospect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the poorest who make the greatest health gains from the introduction of a sugar tax or a ban on junk food advertising. Labor should be mindful of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why aren’t sugar taxes a live policy option? Why isn’t banning junk food likely to happen despite Scamps’s private member’s bill? Why haven’t we already banned gambling advertising or poker machines (found in almost every club and pub save for Western <b>Australia</b>)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, it’s because of concerns about the pressure that might be applied by powerful industries, including the food and gambling industries, and mainstream media, which relies on the advertising revenues. That is how power and influence work in politics. Standing up to that requires bravery, a finite commodity in modern parliaments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bid to stave off the prospect of a sugar tax ever becoming a reality, the soft-drink industry has started moving away from its more sugary products towards low-calorie, low-sugar alternatives. It is a chicken-or-the-egg argument to work out what came first: the moral imperative of the shift or the shift as a response to declining sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their part, governments have sought to substitute better labelling and industry disclosure for consideration of a sugar tax or a ban on advertising. It’s a bad public policy decision designed for a political outcome; doing so imposes cost burdens on the sector and, let’s face it, most people don’t read food labels anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downsides to obesity are obvious: to one’s lifestyle, mental state and physical health. Given that <b>Australia</b> enjoys a universal healthcare system, the state – as much as, if not more than, the individual – is bearing the financial burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately the arrival of the <b>pandemic</b> detracted from the profile given to the work of James Muecke, the 2020 Australian of the Year. He used his time in that role to try to raise awareness about the damaging impact of a high-sugar diet, engaging constructively with governments to attempt to achieve change. Perhaps he needed to take a more combative approach to hit the headlines, the approach taken by his successor. However, that’s not the style of someone as considered as Muecke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes on sugary drinks have been adopted in dozens of overseas jurisdictions. A sugar tax need not be pegged at the exorbitant rate of that on tobacco products to be effective. A study of the 10 per cent tax in Mexico found a nearly 8 per cent reduction in consumption. Surprise, surprise: sin taxes do work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acuteness of obesity problems in Pacific Islands nations led many of them implement sugar taxes. Britain has two tiers of sugar intensity that attract an increasing tax impost. It’s not a radical idea, even if our political leaders seem incapable of thinking outside the box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to calls for such a tax when he was prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull suggested there were enough taxes on consumption already and policy needed to concentrate on education and awareness – in other words, collect revenue from somewhere else so as to spend money to deal with a problem that, as has been shown in other countries, can be addressed with a direct financial push.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, diet and obesity are hugely complex issues. The unintended consequences of an advertising ban need to be well thought through before legislation is rushed into practice. Taxing sugar, on the other hand, is simple and proven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the writing on the wall, the Australian Beverages Council announced plans for voluntary reductions over time. Let’s help them along with a financial incentive that will have broad social benefits and contribute to the national bottom line. Perhaps with threats of advertising bans to follow soon if they don’t get it done.

</div><div class="author">ANNE HOLLONDS </div><div>841 words</div><div>12 August 2022</div><div>The Australian</div><div>AUSTLN</div><div>Australian</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When federal, state and territory attorneys-general meet on Friday, I hope they will consider this question: Why have so many children in youth detention cen­tres attempted suicide this year and what is driving these young people to such desperation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Perth’s Banksia Hill youth detention centre alone there were 20 suicide attempts and 285 occasions of self-harm in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These children frequently have been locked down in <b>isolation</b> in their cells for more than 22 hours a day. They were not receiving education, recreation or rehabilitation programs because of chronic staffing shortages in a system that had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the situation at Banksia Hill requires urgent intervention, it sadly is not an isolated issue. Five years on from the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory, the serious problems continue in youth justice systems across <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope our attorneys-general will consider the fact children in youth detention need care and treatment for complex neurological disabilities, trauma and serious <b>mental health</b> problems. Instead of receiving the specialist care they need, too many children are incarcerated in harmful conditions with lifelong adverse effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These children come from families living with poverty and disadvantage. They are disproportionately Indigenous children, and most come via the child protection system. Some are only 10 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “tough on crime” approach is popular with governments, particularly ahead of elections. But evidence indicates that harsh punitive approaches, such as tougher bail laws, are not working to increase community safety in comparison to investment in community-based early intervention, diversion and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b> is out of step internationally and the public needs to know the truth: we are wasting public money because locking up children does not reduce crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries have implemented community-based welfare approaches that have been shown to reduce youth offending and keep the community safer. Early intervention and support provided in the community works better to reduce offending than even the best rehabilitation programs provided in prisons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>’s youth justice crisis does not exist in <b>isolation</b>. It is an outcome of our long-term failure to make child wellbeing a national priority. It is an inevitable outcome of policies and service systems that are failing to provide children and their families with the support they need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades of evidence show our health, education and social service systems are fragmented and not fit for purpose for struggling children and their families. Many of these families have told me directly about their frustrations at being unable to access basic support services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b> ranks 32nd out of 38 <span class="companylink">OECD</span> countries on child wellbeing. In <b>Australia</b> you are more likely to be in poverty if you are a child than if you are an adult, and in recent years increasing numbers of children have been removed from their families because of child safety risks, domestic violence and homelessness. Children in these situations are more likely to enter the youth justice system and to experience serious problems in later life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The human and economic costs will continue to grow while we fail to prioritise child wellbeing in the design of our basic policy and service systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many developed countries, <b>Australia</b> has no national plan for child wellbeing and no minister for children. Nor do we have a cross-portfolio taskforce to address clear system failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b> cannot continue to simply tinker around the edges. We need a national approach to address the underlying causes of youth crime, with national leadership and collaboration across jurisdictions. This is not only about redesigning the youth justice system but also the way it interacts with the other systems that are meant to support children and their families. The challenge of co-ordinating national efforts and delivering improved outcomes is an early test of the Albanese government’s commitment to <b>Australia</b>’s human rights obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus has promised $79m for justice reinvestment programs. After decades of neglect, the chronic crisis in <b>Australia</b>’s youth justice systems also will need a shared commitment from all jurisdictions to build a national road map for evidence-based systems reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice reinvestment approaches in local communities need to be backed by broader cross-portfolio redesign of the basic systems of support. This should include integrating schools and health services in local communities to enable children and their families to get the help they need, and redesigning the way schools operate because we have long known that disengagement from education is a key risk factor for youth crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday’s important meeting of attorneys-general is an opportunity to begin a path of systems reform that will require a whole-of-government commitment to implement the evidence of what works to reduce youth offending and prioritise the wellbeing of children and young people. This is an opportunity for action that matters to us all. Anne Hollonds is the National Children’s Commissioner.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I read about the uncertainty in our economy, and the things that caused it, I see a profound disconnect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, the message repeated most often is that our economy has weathered a series of shocks, and that markets can be expected to stabilise once interest rates normalise and inflation comes back under control. On the other hand, experts in the causes of these shocks are telling us that though recent events are unprecedented, they are probably not as extraordinary as we might hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, we have faced a perfect storm – disrupted supply chains due to the <b>pandemic</b>, unprecedented flooding, bushfires and droughts, and a global energy supply crunch caused by the war in Ukraine. But thinking more carefully about the underlying causes of this perfect storm, there are good reasons to expect that we need to be preparing for more of the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we want the promised economic stabilisation to be anything more than a temporary reprieve before the next wave of shocks hit, then we need to invest more in resilience. We need to get into a position to treat future shocks less as emergencies, and more as foreseeable, understood challenges to be overcome as part of our day to day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The responses we have seen in the past couple of years – massive fiscal and monetary policy interventions, deploying our armed forces, profound restrictions on civil liberties – were necessary for us to overcome the immediate crises we have faced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as necessary as they were, they are fundamentally incompatible with long-term stability and economic growth. If our objective is to secure our long-term future, we cannot afford for them to become our template for managing future shocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, we need to ask ourselves a deceptively simple question: What would it take for life in <b>Australia</b> to go on smoothly when the next perfect storm comes? Answering that question is a monumentally complex task, requiring us to develop a detailed and informed perspective on our existing capacity to withstand all kinds of threats. That includes natural disasters, disruptions to global supply chains, sophisticated cyber attacks by state actors, or geopolitical crises in our region, but for all practical purposes the list goes on forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we think about how to grapple with the problem, it is clear governments will need to take a leadership role in the transformation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are ultimately the organisations best positioned to strengthen our critical infrastructure assets, build more excess capacity into supply chains for critical products, embed the <b>mental-health</b> services required to help communities recover, and undertake the actuarial analysis required to budget for these kinds of challenges into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, we will all have a role to play, and we all have a stake in this. Leaders of organisations across all of society will need to respond to changing expectations around security and reliability, whether from stakeholders, customers or investors. Moreover, in order to do their job well, governments will need outside support to build capability in areas that barely existed 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means using technology to develop an integrated, up-to-date understanding of the location and condition of the interrelated network of assets that support our economy – and an assessment of their vulnerability to all manner of complex threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also means developing systems for incident management that enable all facets of our disaster response and recovery efforts to be optimised in real time; from emergency services dispatch, to traffic management, to balancing the energy grid, to the distribution of relief after the fact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it means designing laws that give our leaders the authority they need to co-ordinate both public and private resources to respond to a crisis, while respecting the rights and liberties that we cherish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australians have been well served by our governments in the past three years; I think we should be optimistic about the ability of our political and public service institutions to deliver this change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all the indications are that they are leaning into the task. The federal government’s newly created role of Special Envoy for Disaster Recovery, held by NSW senator Tony Sheldon working alongside Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt, is a critical step in ensuring much-needed support is delivered to communities when natural disasters hit. But we must all recognise that they cannot do it alone – the task we are facing now will require another unprecedented collective effort.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REGIONAL WORKING FAMILIES DESPAIR AS RENTALS VANISH &amp; THEY MOVE KIDS ON TO STREETS WORKING families who are loading their children into cars and tents for a life on the streets are the face of a new generation of homelessness – a crisis which is decimating the middle class amid urgent calls for affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investigation by The Daily Telegraph found a dire shortage of rental homes has forced tradies, families, business owners and other professionals to live in shanty towns, motels, cars and even on a balcony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relentless natural disasters have wiped out homes on the coast and inland, while city buyers and cashed-up investors snap up much of the remaining stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel McDonell and her partner Clinton Harris are spending every minute in fear of the sheriff knocking on their door after the lease on their Barrack Heights emergency accommodation expired a week ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple and their four children have packed their bags and are looking for tents, afraid they will have to go join other homeless people sleeping in a carpark along Lake Illawarra in Wollongong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I keep having panic attacks, it’s just horrible. Honestly, if I didn’t have kids, I’d just, I’d just get rid of myself. I don’t do it because of the kids,” Ms McDonell said through tears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are (people) sleeping along the lake in the carpark there, we might end up there I don’t know … It’s too cold to be outside … it shouldn’t be happening in <b>Australia</b>.” Mr Harris works at the docks and the couple can afford a home for $550 a week – but despite offering advanced rent of $3000, they still haven’t found anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m just looking for a secure tent, a durable tent that won’t blow away in the wind or get flooded, that I might be able to lock or something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(My) five year old is really struggling, he keeps asking if it’s time to go and where he is going to put his toys. The 14-year-old won’t get out of bed, it’s really affecting her <b>mental health</b>. The other kids are just quiet, they don’t know what to do.” Anglicare NSW’s southern NSW disability and housing manager Danea Cowell said she had witnessed harrowing stories like Ms McDonell’s countless times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have quite a few people who have been living in their car, couch surfing. We have a 20-year-old living on someone’s balcony, people just living in the bush,” she said. “We are seeing a trend of no fault evictions … just because landlords know they can rent it out at double the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Historically, down the south coast, it’s been low socio-economic and a lot of retirees. That was exacerbated by the fires, floods and <b>Covid</b>. We’ve just been pushed and pushed and pushed .” Bega MP Dr Michael Holland said the government should consider incentives like tax relief or discounts to encourage people to rent out their properties instead of putting them on <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We need people to have rental opportunities, small houses they might be able to occupy ... there is too much concrete thinking in terms of developers.” In the Hunter, single mum Charmaine Brookes and her four children are staying in a motel for $875 a week and eat microwave meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had a brand new house in a new estate. To go from that and not being able to eat ... I skip meals regularly because I can’t feed anyone. Actually, I haven’t eaten in two days,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My six year old started blaming himself because on his birthday he got presents ... he said to me ‘Mum did my birthday make us broke and poor?’.” Ms Brookes and Ms McDonell are both attempting to raise funds through crowdsourcing platform <span class="companylink">GoFundMe</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor housing spokeswoman Rose Jackson called on the state government to “urgently invest in affordable housing, particularly in our regions, and abolish no-grounds evictions”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NSW Department of Planning</span> said in a statement yesterday that $2.8bn was being spent to “supercharge” the supply of housing over the next four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement said councils had the ability to “cap” the number of days a home was able to be let as a short-term, or holiday, rental. LIFELINE 13 11 44</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the tears flowed just seconds after a 12-round war in the boxing ring, Danny Garcia let it all out, describing the dark days he’d experienced over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future Hall of Fame boxer choked up as he described his two-year battle with anxiety and depression, a problem that sent him spiralling into an uncontrollable mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only through the love of his family, particularly his dad, Angel, that he got through, and his only salvation was to get into the ring again and do what he does best – world-class boxing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garcia made a triumphant return and now has his sights on a world title. The insight and raw emotion of Garcia’s recent journey is a snapshot of what is going on in the lives of so many people, particularly those affected by the <b>pandemic</b>. Long <b>Covid</b> has catapulted millions of people into a haze of anxiety, panic attacks and crippling lethargy and debilitation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the silent – although not so silent these days – killer of our modern, post-<b>pandemic</b> reality. And regional <b>Australia</b> – those in the bush – are the ones doing it the toughest after being abandoned by city-centric dictator premiers. It is why we must never underestimate the toll <b>mental health</b> impacts are having on us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just about everybody reading this will know a person who is struggling in that <b>mental health</b> space. What about the physical and mental impact on those poor souls in Victoria, subjected to the longest <b>Covid lockdown</b> of any city on the planet. That type of torture has sent many thousands of people broke, to the brink of despair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re-electing Dan Andrews would be the greatest political own goal in our history. He should be forever consigned to the political history books as a manipulative fool. That type of dictatorship must never be rewarded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bush, in particular, was taunted by poor <b>pandemic</b> decision-making by state premiers, who only had their eye on the capital cities. Danny Garcia’s heartfelt and emotional post-victory speech exemplified why <b>mental health</b> spending around the globe is so important. For too long, it’s been put into the too-hard basket. But if there’s one thing <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> has taught us, it is that people are fragile and need support when times are tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aussies are not shrinking violets. We’re a tough, resilient lot, a fundamental trait etched into our folklore by the Anzac spirit. But when you see the toughest blokes in sport, elite boxers, crying like babies, talking about dark days, depression and anxiety, it’s time to stand up and take notice. We’re not bulletproof. Invest in your mates and their wellbeing. Check in on people you suspect might be doing it tough. You might just be the circuit-breaker some poor soul needs in their time of need.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BIRMINGHAM 2022 It was a day of carnage on the road but <b>Australia</b>’s world champion Rohan Dennis remained upright to claim gold in the Commonwealth Games men’s individual time trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competitors were confronted by a narrow, technical course that they had not had a look at in race conditions resulting in riders slamming into barriers and sliding through tight corners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis’s main rival and good friend Geraint Thomas, crashed into a barrier just two-minutes into his ride and gave up a lead he was unable to regain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">England’s Dan Bigham also hit the barricades and couldn’t free his bike, forcing him to grab his girlfriend Joscelin Lowden’s bike to finish the torturous 37.4km course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riders had been taken on a reconnaissance drive along the course, but before it was closed to traffic and barriers installed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did realise that some of the corners did tighten up a little bit more than what I thought, so a couple nearly took me out, but I was quickly able to react and avoid that situation,” Dennis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were just going a lot quicker than we were going in recon. We didn’t quite know the speeds we were hitting the corners and sometimes you don’t realise how quick you go in the open roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact was that we didn’t have a proper recon of that course and be able to properly test those corners at a reasonable pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Checking the corners when there is traffic, you don’t know how fast you can take them and you are going two to three times faster than you would in recon. It sometimes catches people out.” Welshman Thomas, who finished third at the recent Tour de France, rode just as fast as Dennis when he was on his bike, but was undone by his early crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recon I did in traffic, the barriers weren’t up so it was pretty pointless really other than knowing when the uphills and downhills are,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But it was my fault at the end of the day — there was a sweeping left and all of a sudden there was a barrier and I was like, ‘Oh shit’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You are kind of used to that, seeing what the course is exactly going to be. “It is just not as organised (the Commonwealth Games) as what we are used to basically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t know what happened with the other crashes, but that’s probably the reason why, no one got to see it (the course) as it would be as we raced.” By staying on his bike and riding with power and discipline, Dennis was able to claim a gold medal he said was 12 years in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite two world championship crowns, Dennis, 32, had only claimed minor medals at Olympic or Commonwealth Games before this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have finally gotten on that top step,” he said. “It has taken 12 years since Delhi (the 2010 Commonwealth Games), I didn’t get close there, but 12 years later I’ve finally got it.” It was Dennis’s first race since June, when he and his Jumbo-Visma team had to abandon the Tour de Suisse because of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-years ago he sensationally abandoned the Tour de France after a dispute with then team Bahrain-Merida that he said was hurting his <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been a rollercoaster to be honest with you, there have been a lot of downs,” he said. “But I’d say, looking back, it has been a pretty good period of time.” Dennis clocked 48:21 to claim the gold medal, with England’s Fred Wright taking silver and Thomas the bronze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aussie Luke Plapp finished fifth, but his chances of a medal were ruined when he lost 60 seconds after he chain came off and then jammed, forcing him to switch bikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mentally, after that I wasn’t in it, to be honest,” he said. Dennis joins some of the greats of Australian cycling in winning the event including former Tour de France champion Cadel Evans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a clean sweep for <b>Australia</b> in the time trials, with Grace Brown putting in a dominant display to win the women’s race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown, <b>Australia</b>’s top-ranked male or female road cyclist this year, blitzed the field across the 28.8km course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former middle and long-distance runner, Brown only started racing in 2016. She now has a Commonwealth Games gold to go with her bronze from the time trial at last year’s Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think especially from an Australian perspective, to win a gold at a Commonwealth Games, it is something that Australian sport really acknowledges and I think that is super special,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the Commonwealth Games for cycling not being huge I still think it is a special thing to have on my resume and I’m proud of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I need to actually invest in a trophy cabinet I think.” Brown did have a minor scare at the start of her race when she couldn’t clip in going down the ramp. But it didn’t matter as she finished 33.35 seconds ahead of England’s Anna Henderson.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">WHERE HAVE ALL THE WORKERS GONE?</span>
</div><div class="author">Helen Trinca </div><div>1835 words</div><div>6 August 2022</div><div>The Australian</div><div>AUSTLN</div><div>Australian</div><div>44</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging inflation and high debt are the common problems for Western countries post-<b>Covid</b>, but the economies are also united in a desperate search for labour. Story by Helen Trinca In Italy, they complain of the lack of “stagionali” – the seasonal agriculture workers and wait staff; in the UK, the lament is for the shortage of Eastern European builders and hospitality workers; and, in Germany, chaos at its airports last months prompted plans to bring in several thousands workers, mainly from Turkey. A dire shortage of key workers is the new global malady, post-<b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <b>Australia</b>, the “where the bloody hell are they?” refrain continues with an unemployment rate of 3.5 per cent, the lowest in almost 50 years. The extraordinary figure means there is about one unemployed person for every vacancy – a dramatic tightening since before the <b>pandemic</b>, when three Australians chased every vacancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading economist Professor Jeff Borland, of the <span class="companylink">University of Melbourne</span>, says there’s no mystery about the shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Where have all the workers gone?” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re all in jobs. We put on an extra 88,000 workers between May and June. The (story) isn’t where the workers have gone; it’s boy, haven’t we created a lot of jobs.” Borland notes our labour force participation has increased from 65.9 per cent in March 2020, before the <b>pandemic</b>, to a June seasonally adjusted figure of 66.8 per cent. That extra percentage point translates to an extra 370,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borland sees no evidence in <b>Australia</b> that workers have opted out of the market – unlike the US where there is more evidence of a “Great Resignation” and older people retiring early because of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>. Instead, he argues, shortages here are largely a result of the dramatic growth caused by government stimulation of the economy during the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borland says that, while border closures “supercharged” shortages in some sectors that employed a high proportion of temporary visa holders, “the really big thing in <b>Australia</b> is just that the economy has run so strongly, and we’ve created so many jobs that, even though we’ve drawn extra people into work, it just hasn’t been enough”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says it’s hard to know if the shortages have peaked but suggests we will not see an extended period where the unemployment rate keeps falling, given the impact that higher interest rates will likely have on job creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borland, who has done extensive work on job readiness of workers argues that the low unemployment rate is proof that we have a pool of good workers well able to fill vacancies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He agrees there is a continuing need to help more long-term unemployed people become “job ready” but says: “On the other hand, it’s been pretty amazing – our capacity to bring unemployed people who’ve been out of the labour force into work. The fact we could draw 88,000 extra people into work last month coming off a period of really good employment does show there’s more good quality there to fill jobs in the way employers want.” One of the sectors desperate for workers is tech, a point made strongly this week as Ed Husic, the federal Industry and Science Minister launched a report from the Tech Council of <b>Australia</b> and the Digital Skills Organisation that argues we need an extra 650,000 people to join the sector by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It highlighted as a key problem the “flatlining” of enrolments in VET (vocational education and training) and called for an Australian Digital Apprenticeship as an effective alternative to tertiary study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tech Council CEO Kate Pounder says huge structural changes are behind the shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Pounder: “We have 860,000 people working in tech jobs today in <b>Australia</b> and those tech jobs have grown 66 per cent since 2005, while the average growth rate across the whole economy was 35 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So it’s been pretty close to double that growth rate for pretty close to a decade.” The new jobs are not just in software companies but in banks, mining companies and government, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s just a huge, huge jobs boom across the economy and we’ve been playing catch-up in terms of training people at the rate required to fill those jobs,” Pounder says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve made some progress. We’ve seen a big uptick in the number of tertiary ICT completions since 2018 but we haven’t seen any change in VET completions.” The tech gap is not a uniquely Australian problem but Pounder says it’s worse here because digitisation has lagged some other countries, so we are now particularly short of people with at least 10 years’ experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed digital apprenticeship would train workers in digital trades – a section of tech that will need about 223,000 people by the end of the decade. The apprenticeship would produce business analysts, technicians, software developers and junior data scientists – jobs that don’t need university courses, says Pounder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pounder says it’s the most effective way to train people for those jobs and is important from an equity point of view given most Australians don’t go to university but need pathways into tech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says immigration will not solve the problem other than in highly skilled jobs needing more experienced people. The report urges government to streamline migration for high-salary, experienced technical roles, and provide tech workers with pathways to permanent residency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council argues that we need to increase the present level of 860,000 tech jobs to 1.2 million by 2030. That means an extra 650,000 people entering the sector, given some will exit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Wexham, chair of National Skills Week, which runs from August 22 -28, says an ageing workforce, the fallout from <b>Covid</b> and reduced migration have collided with a dramatic growth in digital jobs to create the shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cyber security – go back five years, nobody really cared,” he says. “Now it’s top of the tree and we need another 17,000 cybersecurity workers every year.” Increased use of technology in construction and other areas are changing job requirements and adding to demand, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Skills Week is designed to dispel negative perceptions about VET and raise its profile, especially among parents who so often aspire for children to go to university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“University is right for some people, it’s not right for everyone,” says Wexham. “When you look at the money that universities put into promoting themselves and getting students into courses, those courses don’t necessarily relate to where we have skills needs.” The problem has been exacerbated, he says, by universities lowering entry scores (ATAR) to attract more local students as they lose overseas students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a mismatch,” he says. “Three or four years ago, I was told that about 46 per cent of all TAFE NSW enrolments were either university graduates who couldn’t get a job relating to their degree or university students who signed up for the course, and then basically couldn’t complete it, because they don’t have the skills or the desire to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think universities have got a lot to answer for in terms of poaching the workforce without actually considering the economic outcome for the country or indeed, and importantly, the benefit to the student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Encouragingly, there are some dual-sector universities that do a good job in the VET space, universities such as Victoria, <span class="companylink">RMIT</span>, Swinburne.” But parents are a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You take people who have come to <b>Australia</b> from overseas,” he says. “University is a global word, they all understand the word university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve done some work out in the western suburbs of Sydney that shows parents have never heard of tech, never heard of vocational education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They aspire for their children to go to university but don’t fully understand the other opportunities that are available to them in the areas where we now have desperate skills shortages.” He points to the new Baz Luhrmann movie Elvis and says: “All that was filmed and produced on the Gold Coast. Every single one of those skills that went into that production are taught through vocational education. Catherine Martin (the costume designer and co-producer) went to TAFE, she did costume design. (Celebrity cook) Donna Hay went to TAFE and did commercial cookery. (Fashion guru) Nicky Zimmermann went to TAFE. Parents do not understand the opportunities, or indeed the pedigree of TAFE.” Aaron McEwan, a vice-president (research and advisory) at <span class="companylink">Gartner</span> says part of the problem is that “workers are less willing to work the way that they used to work” since the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are definite shortages and some of those shortages have been created by a lack of overseas workers and students coming into the country and all of those types of things,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I think the underlying reality is that people have just been through three years (of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>). They’re exhausted, they’re beaten around, they’ve taken a pretty big hit on their <b>mental health</b>. And they’re also questioning whether the pace of how they were working is sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve seen people leaving industries because they became unviable during the <b>pandemic</b>. Look at the airlines – they’re struggling to get people to come back because they made bad decisions about who they let go. Let’s be frank, they let the best people walk away.” McEwan says the big demand from employers is for “digital dexterity” – the manipulation of emerging technologies. He is seeing companies tackling shortages by hiring people able to use technology rather than creating tech – in effect appointing technically savvy people throughout the organisation rather than simply in the IT department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is not a fan of more VET and less university: “What we need for the future is digital dexterity and social creative skills, and they’re the skills you learn in a pure discipline, a liberal arts degree, an engineering degree, mathematics degree.” Gianni La Cava, research director at the economics research institute, e61, says the skilled migrant story is key to understanding the shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even before <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, the gap between vacancies and jobseekers/employment had been steadily rising since the early 1990s recession,” he says. “This suggests that <b>Australia</b> has been increasingly relying on foreign labor to fill any gaps, and now we have been caught out with the border closures.” Recent e61 research work with the Paul Ramsay Foundation found that, even with shortages, there were limited job opportunities for young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds and in regional areas. Says La Cava: “Our research suggested skill training in <b>Australia</b> too often lacks ‘portability’, which makes it harder for employers to re-skill young people to fill skill shortages. It is essential that we are giving young people portable skills that make them work-ready in a modern dynamic economy.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Struggling students who left school at the bottom of the class are being accepted into prestigious university degrees including engineering, architecture and psychology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Universities made offers to students with Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) scores below 50 – the bottom 10 per cent of high school leavers – for 221 different bachelor degrees this year, placing them at higher risk of failure and financial risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revelation of the low bars being set for academic entry comes as the federal government cracked down on cheating by blocking 40 of the most visited academic cheating websites on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Federation University <b>Australia</b></span>, the <span class="companylink">University of Tasmania</span>, and La Trobe University both accepted students with an ATAR in the 30s – the bottom two per cent of school leavers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspiring teachers can access seven different education degrees with ATAR scores 50 and below, sparking protests from the teachers’ union on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Australian Education Union</span> president Correna Haythorpe warned that students with an ATAR lower than the average of 70 were likely to fail a teaching degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Low university-entry scores for teaching degrees is a growing concern,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Evidence suggests that students admitted with low ATARs are likely to be less successful at university and are less likely to complete their course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The bar must be raised by ­setting minimum entry requirements and making teaching a two-year postgraduate degree.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Federation University spokeswoman blamed an “administrative error’’ for admitting a student with an ATAR of 37 to a teaching degree this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have investigated this matter with the Victorian Teaching Institute, and we are both satisfied that the student is doing well and should be allowed to complete the course,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alarmingly low academic requirements are revealed in ATAR cut-off scores for university ­admissions this year, published on the federal government’s Course Seeker website using ­official data from universities and tertiary admission centres. Starting this year, students who fail to pass at least half their subjects will lose taxpayer subsidies and be forced to pay the full cost of their degree, switch to an easier course or drop out of university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Education ­Department said it did not yet know how many students were failing, and losing taxpayer funding, as a result of the former ­Coalition government’s Job-Ready Graduates legislation that will be reviewed by the new Labor government later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If students fail a course and are kicked out, they will still have to repay the student loans they borrowed through the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP), possibly leaving them with a lifelong debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For a bachelor degree the rule applies if a student does not complete or fails more than 50 per cent of at least eight units until the end of the degree,’’ a spokes­person said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If this occurs students lose access to Commonwealth Supported Places (government subsidy) and to HELP. They can regain access by changing to another course that, for example, might better suit them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If a student has failed or not completed units because of illness, or other unusual stresses or things out of their control in their life, their university can exempt those units from the rule.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Education Department data shows that more than 13,000 students with below-50 ATAR scores applied for university last year, with 55 per cent ­accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 30,000 students ­applied with ATARs between 50 and 70, with three-quarters ­accepted, while nearly all the 29,000 applicants with an ATAR above 90 enrolled in a degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the students with low ATAR scores, 11 per cent were from poorer backgrounds while only 2 per cent were from wealthy families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the highest achievers, 38 per cent were wealthy and 17 per cent were from poorer families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher education policy ­expert Andrew Norton, professor in the practice of higher education policy at the Centre for ­Social Research and Methods at the <span class="companylink">Australian National University</span>, warned that students admitted with low academic results were the most likely to drop out of university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said half the students with an ATAR below 50 would fail to complete their course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Often they are equity students admitted under special ­arrangements,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nevertheless, they are coming in with what looks like poor academic preparation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am concerned that some students will be expose to financial risk because they have a high chance of not completing their degree.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Education Minister Jason Clare revealed the <span class="companylink">Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency</span> (TEQSA) had blocked 40 cheating websites. Students had used the websites to buy essays or assignments, or pay someone to sit exams on their half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Clare said the 40 websites had been visited 450,000 times a month. “Illegal cheating services threaten academic integrity and expose students to criminals, who often attempt to blackmail students into paying large sums of money,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Blocking these websites will seriously disrupt the operations of the criminals behind them.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University <b>Australia</b> chief executive Catriona Jackson said that “contract cheating” threatened the integrity of a university education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is bad for universities and students, and any action to stop these ruthless outlets is a good thing,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Course Seeker data shows that the <span class="companylink">University of Tasmania</span> admitted business graduates with an ATAR of 30 this year, while <span class="companylink">RMIT University</span> set a low threshold of 48.4 for its Bachelor of Psychology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the <span class="companylink">University of NSW</span> accepted only students with an ATAR over 85 for its civil engineering degree, La Trobe University lowered its cut-off to 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an accounting and finance degree, the <span class="companylink">Australian Catholic University</span> set a cut-off barely below 50, while the <span class="companylink">University of Tasmania</span> admitted architecture students with an ATAR of just 44.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Federation University <b>Australia</b></span> this week scrapped its Bachelor of Arts degree, blaming a drop in student enrolments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The ongoing <b>COVID</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> has caused a significant ­decline in international enrolments, and we are now in our third year of declining student enrolments,’’ acting vice-chancellor Wendy Cross said on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have also seen a drop in domestic student enrolments generally due to online learning fatigue that continues to significantly impact the university’s ­financial position.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Tertiary Education Union Victorian assistant secretary Sarah Roberts said an arts degree was a “bedrock offering for all universities’’. “This is a demoralising day for humanities in Victoria (and) a hammer blow for students who live regionally and want to study arts,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An <span class="companylink">ACU</span> spokeswoman said the lowest “raw ATAR” for its accounting course was 49 for one student whose ATAR was adjusted to meet the published cut-off of 58.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It does not mean that there are other students accepted with that as a raw ATAR in that course,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are many cases where circumstances such as domestic violence, sudden illness, <b>mental health</b>, etcetera, affect final exam results and ATAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These students would have missed a university education without adjustment factors.”</p>

</div><div class="author">EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER </div><div>417 words</div><div>5 August 2022</div><div>The Australian</div><div>AUSTLN</div><div>Australian</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crescent Capital, Evolution Healthcare and APM are expected to line up to buy <b>New Zealand</b>-based rehabilitation company Habit Health when it hits the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private equity owner, Livingbridge, is getting set for a divestment, hiring advisory firm Stanton Road Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sale process is now not set to launch until next year, as Livingbridge waits for the dust to settle from <b>New Zealand</b>’s latest <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Habit Health is <b>New Zealand</b>’s largest integrated health provider, offering physiotherapy rehabilitation, occupational health, Employee Assistance Program services and fitness clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It carries out high-end clinical work such as counselling for <b>mental health</b> disorders and serious physical rehabilitation work after accidents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funding is sourced from the government’s Accident Compensation scheme and corporate counselling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Habit Health has more than 100 locations across <b>New Zealand</b> with 500 staff members after merging with Southern Rehab in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business is expected to sell for more than $200m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is believed to generate about $NZ25m ($22.6m) of annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in normal market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an acquisition would make sense for disability services provider APM, which listed in <b>Australia</b> last year and has a $3.05bn market value, the questions are whether it wants to expand in the <b>New Zealand</b> market and where the earnings growth will come from, given <b>New Zealand</b>’s market size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DataRoom understands that APM will take a look at the business when a sale starts. <b>New Zealand</b> private equity firms may be interested, while Mercury Capital has been keen to invest in assets across the Tasman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crescent Capital is typically an eager participant when it comes to healthcare sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Queensland Investment Corporation</span> purchased Evolution Healthcare, a leading provider of healthcare services in <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand</b>, for at least $700m last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say Livingbridge has been looking to sell Habit Health for some time, but plans were delayed due by the <b>pandemic</b>. Livingbridge, a mid-market, London-based private equity firm that launched in 1995, last year purchased Everlight Radiology, <b>Australia</b>’s largest teleradiology provider, for at least $500m from Intermediate Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was its largest acquisition in <b>Australia</b> and complemented its Better Medical and Habit Health platforms in <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand</b>. In the past year, it also purchased <b>Australia</b>-based Waste Services Group from <span class="companylink">The Riverside Company</span> and its backers.</p>

</div><div class="author">JARED LYNCH EXCLUSIVE </div><div>836 words</div><div>5 August 2022</div><div>The Australian</div><div>AUSTLN</div><div>Australian</div><div>18</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        <span class="companylink">Ramsay Health Care</span>, <b>Australia</b>’s biggest private hospital operator, has signed a five-year contract with HCF in a deal it says will improve the long-term affordability of private healthcare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agreement with the not-for-profit fund comes days after Ramsay terminated its contract with <b>Australia</b>’s second-biggest health fund, <span class="companylink">Bupa</span>, after failing to agree on a funding increase following months of negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> members now face hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket fees if they are treated in one of Ramsay’s 72 Australian hospitals from October. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> says the <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> termination may delay Ramsay’s de-leveraging but will not “immediately impact” its rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramsay’s agreement with HCF is beyond the usual two-to-three year funding contracts between hospitals and health funds, and is understood to cover what Ramsay was looking for with <span class="companylink">Bupa</span>: soaring hospital costs. It is the first time a hospital provider has secured a five-year funding agreement from a health insurer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HCF chief executive Sheena Jack said: “This isn’t a short-term, transactional deal.” She said the agreement was aimed at ensuring the ongoing sustainability and affordability of <b>Australia</b>’s private health sector via the funding of alternative services such as at-home care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At home rehabilitation is about one-third of the cost of a hospital stay. In the past year, Ramsay says it has saved health funds about $16m via its Ramsay Connect “home hospital” service. It has treated about 3000 patients via the service and expects that number to double in the next year, generating further savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This strategic collaboration will provide the opportunity to explore the needs of HCF members through a caring and progressive healthcare provider with certainty that we will be able to jointly deliver effective, sustainable models of care that put the patient first,” Ms Jack said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over the coming years we will work closely with Ramsay to further demonstrate our commitment to fostering collaborative relationships with our hospital provider network.” Under the new agreement, Ramsay and HCF will establish a joint committee to develop “innovative service models” that reflect changing consumer needs. This includes broadening the offer of Ramsay Connect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramsay – which is subject to a $20bn takeover from <span class="companylink">KKR</span> – has also begun moving its <b>mental health</b> services outside hospitals and into the community, opening 11 psychology clinics across <b>Australia</b>, with plans to establish 20 more in the next two years. The community clinics have helped keep Ramsay’s 1100 <b>mental health</b> hospital beds for those who are acutely unwell, generating further savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramsay <b>Australia</b> chief executive Carmel Monaghan said HCF had recognised the increased hospital costs and its members would have access to a “wider range of treatment options” under the new deal. “With HCF it’s great to see how a fund is willing to provide excellent services to its members. They understand what their members want and they’re willing to fund quality services,” Ms Monaghan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Where you work well with health funds is you recognise in tough times, good or bad, you’re going to help each other. We’ve got to be sustainable. Hospitals have had a very tough few years and health funds haven’t.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are really pleased to have collaborated with HCF on an agreement that recognises the increased costs hospitals are facing and will help to achieve better co-ordinated care with great outcomes for patients.” Since the start of the <b>pandemic</b>, Ramsay has secured new funding contracts with <span class="companylink">NIB</span>, <span class="companylink">Medibank</span>, Australian Health Service Alliance – which represents more than 20 funds – DVA and the Australian Regional Health Group. <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> also has agreed to fund at-home care services via its new agreements with Melbourne-based hospital operators Epworth and Cabrini.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite months of negotiations, <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> and Ramsay were not able to strike a similar deal, disagreeing over the indexation rate. <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> is understood to offer a 1.5 per cent funding increase, although this figure is disputed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramsay was seeking to split the difference in hospital costs, which have surged 7 per cent. Hospital groups have had to pay millions of dollars in personal protective equipment and other <b>pandemic</b>-related costs and higher nurse wages, which have come under pressure amid a chronic national shortage. <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> said the failed <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> talks may prevent Ramsay from bringing its leverage in line with its rating guidelines in the near term but will not immediately impact on its rating. “We revised our outlook on Ramsay … to negative, from stable, in April 2022 to reflect the rising risk of slower deleveraging due to elevated costs stemming from the outbreak of the Omicron <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> variant and ongoing ramp-up issues facing the health sector. The negative outlook also encompasses the additional deleveraging risk as a result of the failed contract negotiations,” <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> said. “Ramsay continues to have options to aid deleveraging, including cost cuts, capex adjustments and a potential sale of its Ramsay Sime Darby (JV).”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients ‘panicking’ A POPULAR drug to treat children and adults with ADHD has been wiped from Australian shelves amid a major supply chain crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families are struggling to get their hands on Ritalin, a stimulant drug used for the attention disorder – an illness that has been on a sharp rise in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drug scarcity comes as the Therapeutic Good Administration (<span class="companylink">TGA</span>) reports a shortage of several popular medications, including antidepressants, high blood pressure medication and drugs to treat asthma and clotting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychiatrist Tanveer Ah-med said patients had been struggling to go to school and work with the sudden shortage of the drug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve had several calls from late last week to early this week of people not being able to pick up their meds,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has left people panicking and a range of knock-on effects; people aren’t functioning as well at work, some people have been forced to take days off, kids are more behaviourally disturbed in the school yard.” Dr Ahmed has put patients on substitute medications, but said swapping <b>mental health</b> drugs was “not ideal as not everyone is going to respond in the same way” and some people had to go without.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">TGA</span>’s drug shortage notice board lists Ritalin’s 10mg, 20mg and 30mg doses in short supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplier <span class="companylink">Novartis Pharmaceuticals <b>Australia</b></span> said the issue was due to a “manufacturing issue”, which had been resolved and supply had resumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tofranil, an antidepressant to manage depression, anxiety and panic disorder is unavailable, along with hypertension drug Dibenzyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Royal Australian and <b>New Zealand</b> College of Psychiatrists president Vinay Lakra said he had spoken to the ­federal government about the persisting issue of medicine shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over the course of the last two years and even earlier, we’ve been aware of a shortage of various medications,” he said. “The government needs to be find solutions for the availability of key critical medications. We’ve been in the <b>pandemic</b> for a little while, we need to be doing this better.” Dr Lakra said the shortage was causing relapses. He urged patients to speak to their doctors, plan ahead, and to look at compounding pharmacies who could create the medication. “People become unwell as a result of not having medication available to them, or they are changing over – every relapse contributes to problems for the individual, for the family, for everybody,” he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a day of carnage on the road, <b>Australia</b>’s world champion Rohan Dennis remained upright to claim gold in the Commonwealth Games men’s individual time trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confronted by a narrow, technical course that they hadn’t had a look at in race conditions, riders slammed into barriers and slid through tight corners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis’s main rival, good friend Geraint Thomas, crashed into a barrier just two-minutes into his ride and gave up a lead he was unable to regain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">England’s Dan Bigham also hit the barricades and couldn’t free his bike, forcing him to grab his girlfriend Joscelin Lowden’s bike to finish the torturous 37.4km course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riders had been taken on a reconnaissance drive along the course, but before it was closed to traffic and barriers installed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did realise that some of the corners did tighten up a little bit more than what I thought, so a couple nearly took me out, but I was quickly able to react and avoid that situation,” Dennis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were just going a lot quicker than we were going in recon. We didn’t quite know the speeds we were hitting the corners and sometimes you don’t realise how quick you go in the open roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact was that we didn’t have a proper recon of that course and be able to properly test those corners at a reasonable pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Checking the corners when there is traffic, you don’t know how fast you can take them and you are going two to three times faster than you would in recon. It sometimes catches people out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welshman Thomas, who finished third at the recent Tour de France, rode just as fast as Dennis when he was on his bike, but was undone by his early crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recon I did in traffic, the barriers weren’t up so it was pretty pointless really other than knowing when the uphills and downhills are,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But it was my fault at the end of the day — there was a sweeping left and all of a sudden there was a barrier and I was like, ‘Oh shit’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You are kind of used to that, seeing what the course is exactly going to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is just not as organised (the Commonwealth Games) as what we are used to basically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t know what happened with the other crashes, but that’s probably the reason why, no one got to see it (the course) as it would be as we raced.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By staying on his bike and riding with power and discipline, Dennis was able to claim a gold medal he said was 12 years in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite two world championship crowns, Dennis, 32, had only claimed minor medals at Olympic or Commonwealth Games before this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have finally gotten on that top step,” he said. “It has taken 12 years since Delhi (the 2010 Commonwealth Games), I didn’t get close there, but 12 years later I’ve finally got it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Dennis’s first race since June, when he and his Jumbo-Visma team had to abandon the Tour de Suisse because of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-years ago he sensationally abandoned the Tour de France after a dispute with then team Bahrain-Merida that he said was hurting his <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been a rollercoaster to be honest with you, there have been a lot of downs,” he said. “But I’d say, looking back, it has been a pretty good period of time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis clocked 48:21 to claim the gold medal, with England’s Fred Wright taking silver and Thomas the bronze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aussie Luke Plapp finished fifth, but his chances of a medal were ruined when he lost 60 seconds after he chain came off and then jammed, forcing him to switch bikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mentally, after that I wasn’t in it, to be honest,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a clean sweep for <b>Australia</b> in the time trials, with Grace Brown putting in a dominant display to win the women’s race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown, <b>Australia</b>’s top-ranked male or female road cyclist this year, blitzed the field across the 28.8km course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former middle and long-distance runner, Brown only started racing in 2016. She now has a Commonwealth Games gold to go with her bronze from the time trial at last year’s Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think especially from an Australian perspective, to win a gold at a Commonwealth Games, it is something that Australian sport really acknowledges and I think that is super special,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the Commonwealth Games for cycling not being huge I still think it is a special thing to have on my resume and I’m proud of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I need to actually invest in a trophy cabinet I think.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown did have a minor scare at the start of her race when she couldn’t clip in going down the ramp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it didn’t matter one bit as she finished 33.35 seconds ahead of England’s Anna Henderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Could have died’: Victims of freak cycling crash speak out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Emily Benammar in Birmingham</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A family caught up in a freak accident at the velodrome say their children were lucky not to have been “seriously injured or killed” while a friend was left with a ‘machete-like’ cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">England’s Matt Walls and his bike were catapulted over the track barrier and into the crowd on the final lap of a qualifying heat for the men’s scratch race this week after a high-speed crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paramedics worked on Walls for forty minutes before he was taken to hospital while multiple members of the public required medical assistance after being left “covered in blood.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting on the terrifying experience, Hugh Colvin, who was sitting in the stands with his two young children and some friends, said Walls’ bike landed where his kids had been sitting before they moved for a better vantage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It all happened so incredibly quickly at the speed the cyclists were going,” Colvin told the BBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can see the trajectory of the bike, it came through, grazed my daughter’s shoulder, and one of the photos you can see we are obviously underneath the wheel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was facing the other way because I’d turned my head, but looking back at the photos it must have been within centimetres, millimetres, of our heads and obviously close enough to graze my daughter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident drew fierce criticism from Olympic hero Chris Hoy who said the lack of protective screening at the venue was “a disgrace.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isle of Man cyclist Matt Bostock, who was involved in the horrific crash, says the incident wasn’t a freak accident and is also calling greater safety measures at velodromes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There has to be something done because it’s going down as a freak accident, but it has happened before,” said Bostock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t know how many freak accidents become a normal accident. I dread to think if it had been worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It should be a proactive decision to try and make it safer before it’s a terrible accident.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colvin’s wife Laura, who was not at the velodrome, said watching the incident back over makes it hard to come to terms with just how much worse things could have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What has been quite hard for us to get our head around is being able to see from the photographs that were taken of the incident exactly how close this came to being a complete catastrophe,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And how close our two younger children came to being seriously injured or killed. And that has been the main thing we’ve had to reflect on over the last few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we had known for a moment that there was a risk that a bike with an adult male going at that speed could come into contact with my seven-year-old daughter, my family would never have been there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura added that a friend who attended the event with her husband was awaiting surgery on the injuries sustained which doctors likened to damage caused by a machete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been really difficult for him, he’s still waiting for surgery. In addition to the soft tissue and muscle injury he’s got a partially severed tendon in his arm, so it is the start of a long road to recovery for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He suffered a laceration to the bone which the hospital have described as being like a machete injury.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walls was discharged 12 hours after the accident with stitches to his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other riders involved in the incident – the Isle of Man’s Matt Bostock and Canada’s Derek Gee – have both been discharged from hospital with the former confident of riding in this weekend’s road race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Birmingham 2022 has confirmed an investigation is underway amid calls for a total review of cycling protocols.</p>

</div><div class="author">JARED LYNCH </div><div>661 words</div><div>5 August 2022</div><div>02:01</div><div>The Australian - Online</div><div>AUSTOL</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life has become more stressful than <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> lockdowns, a report has found, with Australians’ <b>mental health</b> levels plunging amid heightened geopolitical instability, the Reserve Bank’s rapid interest rate rises and a ­series of natural disasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, <span class="companylink">KPMG</span> and Smiling Mind will launch the Australian Wellbeing Index, which shows workers suffering from a different kind of long <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index shows people have experienced a decline in their ­social connections as they become more isolated and less connected with their social networks as the <b>pandemic</b> enters its third year. <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> has sparked a shift to remote or hybrid working, where being at the office full-time from 9am to 5pm is no longer necessary and neither is taking the humble “sickie” – even if you are unwell. Employees have managed to structure their work days around home life, rather than the other way around, erasing the need for “unplanned absences”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unions have also weighed in, stepping up demands on employers to better protect workers by ensuring all employees who can work from home do so, going further than advice ­released by the country’s leading doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many have welcomed this new-found flexibility, others have struggled with inconsistent policies among employers, heightening anxiety levels, the index found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Dempster, <span class="companylink">KPMG</span>’s <b>mental health</b> advisory lead, said workers were feeling a lack of control as the <span class="companylink">RBA</span> embarks on its most aggressive series of interest rate rises since 1994; war continues to rage in Ukraine, driving up the cost of fuel and food; and China flexes its military muscle following Nancy ­Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With the background of global political instability and some of the natural disasters that we are having on a very regular basis, there is a general feeling that people have of limited control in the broader environment,” Mr Dempster said. “What that means in the workplace … is if I’ve got to work today, do I as an individual have some control over when I do it, how I do it and the way it’s done?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Dempster said this did not necessarily mean offering more leave or cutting hours. He said meaning and purpose in job tasks were also important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>pandemic</b> has also made the role of line managers more difficult, which has affected employee <b>mental health</b>. “The glue that really does hold it all together is the quality of the managers,” Mr Dempster said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those structures have fallen away over the last two years where people work remotely. There might be tactical conversations during the day about particular things but there’s not that sort of walk past the desk or walk around the office or see them in the lunchroom or just those incidental kind of connections that we would have otherwise had.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian Wellbeing Index slipped 0.9 percentage points to 48.6 out of a total of 100 in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2021. Data was collected from 226,103 people, who completed more than 880,954 surveys. Key factors contributing to a low wellbeing score include more people experiencing challenges with stress (40 per cent), focus and concentration (43 per cent) and sleep (34 per cent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Human resources bosses at some of <b>Australia</b>’s biggest companies told The Australian last week that maintaining employee wellbeing was the biggest challenge in the shift to working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Smiling Mind chief executive Addie Wootten said employers could reap the benefits if they get the balance right, particularly in a tight labour market. “Businesses are really struggling with staff turnover. So if you want to link it to an economic benefit, if you can engage your staff and keep them retained, it’s going to save the business a lot of money and also productivity and performance will go up,” Dr Wootten said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crescent Capital, Evolution Healthcare and APM are expected to be the parties that line up to buy <b>New Zealand</b>-based rehabilitation company Habit Health when it hits the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private equity owner Livingbridge is getting set for a divestment, hiring advisory firm Stanton Road Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sale process is now not set to launch until next year, as the private equity owner waits for the dust to settle from <b>New Zealand</b>’s latest <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Habit Health is <b>New Zealand</b>’s largest integrated health provider, offering, physiotherapy rehabilitation, occupational health, Employee Assistance Program services and fitness clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It carries out high end clinical work such as counselling for <b>mental health</b> disorders and other sensitive claims, including areas such as serious physical rehabilitation work from accidents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funding is sourced from the government’s Accident Compensation scheme and corporate counselling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Habit Health has more than 100 locations across <b>New Zealand</b> with 500 staff members after merging with Southern Rehab in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business is expected to sell for more than $200m and the understanding in the market is that it generates about $NZ25m of annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in normal market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an acquisition would be logical for disability services provider APM, which listed in <b>Australia</b> last year and has a $3.05bn market value, the question for the group will be whether it wants to expand in the <b>New Zealand</b> market and where the earnings growth will come from given <b>New Zealand</b>’s market size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DataRoom understands that APM will at least take an initial look at the business when a sale starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> private equity firms may be interested, while Mercury Capital has been keen to invest in assets across the Tasman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crescent Capital is typically an eager participant when it comes to sales processes in the healthcare space, while Evolution Healthcare is a leading provider of healthcare services in <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand</b>, which is why a deal would make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Queensland Investment Corporation</span> purchased Evolution for at least $700m last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say that Livingbridge has been looking to sell Habit Health for some time, but sale plans have been delayed due to the global <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livingbridge, a mid-market, London-based private equity firm that launched in 1995 and is looking to sell Habit Health after it last year purchased Everlight Radiology, <b>Australia</b>’s largest teleradiology provider, for at least $500m from <span class="companylink">Intermediate Capital Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was the largest acquisition in <b>Australia</b> for Livingbridge and at the time, it said that it complimented its Better Medical and Habit Health platforms in <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, it also purchased <b>Australia</b>-based Waste Services Group from <span class="companylink">The Riverside Company</span> and its backers in a deal advised by law firm <span class="companylink">Allens</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A popular drug used to treat children and adults with ADHD has been wiped from Australian shelves amid a major supply chain crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families are struggling to get their hands on Ritalin, a stimulant drug used for the attention disorder — an illness that has been on a sharp rise in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drug scarcity comes as the Therapeutic Good Administration reported a shortage of several popular medications, including antidepressants, high-blood pressure medication and drugs to treat asthma and clotting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychiatrist Dr Tanveer Ahmed said patients had been struggling to go to school and work with the sudden shortage of the drug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve had several calls from late last week to early this week of people not being able to pick up their meds. It has left people panicking and (has) a range of knock-on effects, people aren’t functioning as well at work, some people have been forced to take days off, kids are more behaviourally disturbed in the schoolyard.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medicine shortage July 2022</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Ahmed has been prescribing substitute medications for his patients, but said swapping <b>mental health</b> drugs was not “ideal”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not ideal as not everyone is going to respond in the same way and some people have just had to go without,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">TGA</span>’s drug shortage notice board lists Ritalin’s 10mg, 20mg and 30mg doses in short supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplier <span class="companylink">Novartis Pharmaceuticals <b>Australia</b></span> said the issue was due to a manufacturing issue that has now been resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(The supplier) notified the <span class="companylink">TGA</span> of shortages of multiple strengths of Ritalin … due to a manufacturing issue. <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> has confirmed that the Ritalin LA 60mg shortage is resolved and supply has resumed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tofranil, an antidepressant to manage depression, anxiety and panic disorder, is completely unavailable, as is hypertension drug Dibenzyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Royal Australian and <b>New Zealand</b> College of Psychiatrists President Dr Vinay Lakra has spoken to the federal government about the persistent issue of medicine shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over the course of the last two years — and even earlier — we’ve been aware of a shortage of various medications,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The government needs to find solutions for the availability of key critical medications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve been in the <b>pandemic</b> for a little while, we need to be doing this better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(At the start of the <b>pandemic</b>) I could see this issue persist in 2020 and early 2021, but we are in mid-2022.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Lakra said the shortage was causing relapses, and urged patients to speak to their doctors, plan ahead, and to look at compounding pharmacies who could create the medication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People become unwell as a result of not having medication available to them, or they are changing over — every relapse contributes to problems for the individual, for the family, for everybody,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a cost to be paid for every relapse.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truck driver Mark Lang said he went to the pharmacy to get Ritalin but was told they had none and they were not sure when stock would come in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is none around. I went to my chemist on Saturday and they said ‘we don’t have any’ and that was unusual. He said their suppliers have none and they don’t know when it’s coming in,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Lang said he was now trying a different medication because going without it could impact his ability to focus and work, and made him agitated and “on edge”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have a lot of trouble focusing, I really struggle to focus and stay on task, and I become very easily irritated. I just become a little more on edge,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve now got a script for a different medication.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEAM HEALTH COMMONWEALTH Games chef de mission Petria Thomas has confirmed there have been “significant numbers’’ of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> cases in the Australian team, but so far no competitors have missed their competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas said she wasn’t aware of any circumstances where an Australian <b>Covid</b>-positive athlete had competed and suffered any deleterious performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a mid-Games review of the team’s performance, Thomas said she was pleased the team was leading the medal tally, ahead of Games hosts England. She said the medical team had been working “really hard” to support the athletes, who had been performing at their best amid a fantastic spirit of competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No athlete (with <b>Covid</b>) has missed their event and we don’t expect them to, under our protocols,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are not immune from <b>Covid</b>, there is a lot in the community and it is having a large impact on life and we were expecting it to be the case here.’’ She added: “There have been significant numbers, it would be high for the team.’’ <b>Covid</b> is rampant throughout Britain, where it is treated akin to a common cold, with no <b>isolation</b> requirements, no mask wearing and no legal restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>’s approach has been to test athletes before arrival to minimise the introduction of <b>Covid</b>, as well as wearing masks, but if an athlete has a low level of the virus or is asymptomatic, then they will be cleared to compete. Thomas said the team’s policy was to ensure that no athlete was put at risk or was risking others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the end of the day they have to be medically fit to compete,” she said. Thomas rejected criticism from Kyle Chalmers’ father Brett, who suggested his son had not received appropriate support from the team. Brett Chalmers told Adelaide radio station Mix 102.3: “They (<span class="companylink">Swimming <b>Australia</b></span>) failed hugely, and they’ve allowed the media to dictate the questions and kept going on about it – they’ve failed to look after their athletes.” But Thomas, an Olympic and world champion swimmer, said: “I know the swim team has very good protocols in place to support team members and I have been in the stands and have observed the close-knit team. People (in the team) provide that specific (wellbeing) role. The health of the person is first and foremost.’’ When asked if Chalmers should compete if he was suffering <b>mental health</b> issues, Thomas said: “Kyle is a grown man, he can make the decision to compete.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attention chronic anxiety - science is coming for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cannabis may be the answer when it comes to treating some young people living with <b>mental health</b> conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study, published on Thursday, has shown that a component of the cannabis plant may be effective in treating anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It comes at a time when the issues of deteriorating <b>mental health</b> are in the spotlight as we enter the third year of the <b>Covid pandemic</b>, where two in five young people have a condition requiring professional help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orygen, <b>Australia</b>’s centre of excellence in youth <b>mental health</b>, has found that following 12 weeks of treatment with cannabidiol, young people with treatment-resistant anxiety had an average 42.6% reduction in anxiety severity and impairment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orygen’s executive director Professor Patrick McGorry told The Oz, the results of the study he helped instigate and investigate are “promising” as the current problem with existing treatments of anxiety and depression, such as CBT and anti-depressants, was that “Only 50% of them will respond (to the treatment), the other 50% we haven’t other options.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The research we did explored whether cannabidiol is safe and effective for the age group that hasn’t responded to other form of treatment,” Professor McGorry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We noticed that the impacts on severe anxiety (with this treatment) was that the vast majority felt more in control, slept better and had reduced panic attacks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s an amazing change in the group which has had treatment-resistant, long-standing severe to very severe anxiety.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings are promising for a significant number of young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Australian Bureau of Statistics</span> released data in July which showed anxiety was the most common form of mental ill-health in young people, affecting nearly a third (31.5%) of those aged 16–24 – almost double the rate of the general population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How the study worked</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilot involved 31 participants aged 12–25 who were recruited from Orygen’s primary care services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participants had a diagnosed anxiety disorder and had failed to show significant improvement in anxiety severity following at least five cognitive behavioural therapy sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Participants’ starting dose was one 200mg capsule of cannabidiol per day, which was increased to 400mg after one week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who did not show significant improvement in anxiety symptoms had their dosage increased at 200mg increments up to 800mg per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the findings are promising, further funding into more research in the area is required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"To see a treatment effect in the treatment-resistant group is encouraging, but it could still be a placebo effect. The next step is a randomised controlled trial,\" Professor McGorry said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stewart McSweyn’s horror season has continued with the middle-distance star ruled out of the 1500m because of illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian record holder has been below his best all season after an adverse reaction to a <b>Covid</b> booster shot back in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McSweyn showed he was returning to form two weeks ago at the world championships in Eugene when he made the final.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He returned to home base in London immediately afterwards but fell ill over the last 24 hours with the Australian medical team ruling him out of the 1500m heats which start on Thursday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It comes as <b>Australia</b>’s Commonwealth Games chef de mission Petria Thomas confirmed there have been “significant numbers’’ of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> cases in the Australian team, but so far no competitors have missed their competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas said she wasn’t aware of any circumstances where an Australian <b>Covid</b>-positive athlete had competed and suffered any deleterious performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a mid-Games review of the team’s performance, Thomas said she was pleased the team was leading the medal tally, ahead of Games hosts England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the medical team had been working “really hard” to support the athletes, who had been performing at their best amid a fantastic spirit of competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No athlete (with <b>Covid</b>) has missed their event and we don’t expect them to, under our protocols,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are not immune from <b>Covid</b>, there is a lot in the community and it is having a large impact on life and we were expecting it to be the case here.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: “There have been significant numbers, it would be high for the team.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Covid</b> is rampant throughout Britain, where it is treated akin to a common cold, with no <b>isolation</b> requirements, no mask wearing and no legal restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>’s approach has been to test athletes before arrival to minimise the introduction of <b>Covid</b>, as well as wearing masks, but if an athlete has a low level of the virus or is asymptomatic, then they will be cleared to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas said the team’s policy was to ensure that no athlete was put at risk or was risking others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the end of the day they have to be medically fit to compete,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas rejected criticism from Kyle Chalmers’ father Brett, who suggested his son had not received appropriate support from the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett Chalmers told Adelaide radio station Mix 102.3: “They (<span class="companylink">Swimming <b>Australia</b></span>) failed hugely, and they’ve allowed the media to dictate the questions and kept going on about it – they’ve failed to look after their athletes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Thomas, an Olympic and world champion swimmer, said: “I know the swim team has very good protocols in place to support team members and I have been in the stands and have observed the close-knit team. People (in the team) provide that specific (wellbeing) role. The health of the person is first and foremost.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked if Chalmers should compete if he was suffering <b>mental health</b> issues, Thomas said: “Kyle is a grown man, he can make the decision to compete. He did an outstanding job, he got up and smashed it.’’</p>

</div><div class="author">Toni Hetherington </div><div>923 words</div><div>2 August 2022</div><div>Daily Telegraph</div><div>DAITEL</div><div>Telegraph</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUTHENTICITY AT WORK AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT TO AUSSIES TRENDS Australians are lying less to their bosses and friends on social media in a push to be more authentic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Findings from the Secrets &amp; Lies Report, Chapter Six: ‘Fact, Fiction and What’s New in 22?’, which has just been released by creative transformation company <span class="companylink">WPP</span>, shows big changes in our lying habits in the past four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At work, just 28 per cent of us are lying regularly to our bosses (down from 52 per cent in 2018) and on social media, just 11 per cent of us misrepresent our lives in posts, down a whopping 38 per cent from 49 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WPP Australian and <b>NZ</b> President Rose Herceg, says she finds it charming that Aussies no longer feel the need to lie at work and in our personal lives after more than two years of the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The most illuminating thing is how our lying has changed, particularly that we are far less likely to lie to employers. Most employers have trusted their employees to work from home and be productive and I think that’s been a great thing. As a consequence, workers are less likely to lie,” Herceg says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we only tell fibs when we think we can’t get away with things. But through the <b>pandemic</b> and beyond, there’s been such a level of authenticity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have been and still are beaming into our loungerooms, so there’s no hiding what might be going on at home. And we recognise that the way grown-ups interact is to tell each other the truth, and that’s a very healthy byproduct of the <b>pandemic</b>.” Herceg says a benefit of working this way is cutting to the chase more quickly with bosses, which increases productivity, and identifying when employees may be having <b>mental health</b> issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LITTLE WHITE LIES When it comes to family, however, Australians are a little looser with the truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-nine per cent used work as an excuse to avoid time with family (up 9 per cent since 208) and 42 per cent of us lied about our whereabouts at times to family or friends (up from 27 per cent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lying varied across the generations with Millennials and Generation Z more likely to lie than Generation X and Baby Boomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BE HONEST, YOU’LLFEEL BETTER Herceg says lying and presenting a false version of yourself at work, on social media, to family, or in a relationship will only make you weary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s exhausting to have a false version of yourself in the workplace or relationships,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herceg says the key is finding the right tribe to expose different aspects of the “real you”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s OK to have different versions of ourselves when it’s tied to our friend groups or interests,” she says. “Plenty of people have a closed circle for their family pictures with their kids. They’re not going to let strangers into that world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For me, I might have Professional Rose and Family Rose and Chef Rose. Those three Roses are not a fabrication, but they represent three parts of my life and I can show those faces based on who I would like to lead into that world.” She says authenticity is creeping further into our love lives, too. “In 2022, only 19 per cent of Australians would stay in an unhappy relationship to avoid being alone, down from 27 per cent before the <b>pandemic</b> in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Tell the truth about how you’re really feeling – you will feel a whole lot better when you do,” Herceg advises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUILDING TRUST Rach Wilson is a Brisbane-based married mother of four children – ranging in ages from 24 to 3, with her younger two both autistic, non-verbal with diet limitations and sensory challenges. She says being honest about her struggles has brought more support into her life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Vulnerability helps build trust with people,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As I started sharing some of the really deeper struggles I was having as a mother I started to get a lot more people connecting with me and sending support. The best and easiest way to connect and bond with other people is to be real about stuff, about the challenges.” Wilson, who now runs Divine Relations counselling for parents dealing with similar issues to her, says if you can be honest with your bosses, they can deal with your situations more compassionately and won’t make assumptions about why your work might be slipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Lying, whether they are big or little lies, doesn’t build rapport. One of the things that I say to my clients is, in every relationship you’re either building and bonding or damaging and destroying a relationship. Every lie that gets found out, only makes it harder to trust that they’re ever telling the truth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can trust this DISTRUST is gaining momentum in the online world with the Secrets &amp; Lies Report showing 80 per cent of Australians no longer trust what they read online (up from 68 per cent) and 79 per cent of us feeling information is manipulated in digital platforms. The distrust is attributed to the use of buzzwords with 87 per cent of Australians saying companies choose buzzwords or industry speak that makes it hard for us to get to the truth of what they’re selling and 84 per cent of us wish it was written in plain English.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian responsible for the most controversial decision in Formula One history has bared all in a world exclusive with <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>. Former F1 race-director Michael Masi reveals he has suffered abuse, been threatened and feared for his life after Lewis Hamilton was denied the title in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian who made the most controversial decision in Formula One history has broken his seven-month silence to reveal he feared for his life in the wake of the bombshell call that cost Lewis Hamilton his 8th world title.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Telegraph, former Formula One race-director Michael Masi has admitted he was scared to walk down the street after he was bombarded with death-threats and hate mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raised in his grandmother’s four-bedroom home in Fairfield, the Western Sydney boy who scored his dream job as F1’s top steward became the “most hated man in the world” when he imposed a championship costing penalty on Hamilton during the title deciding F1 race in December last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were some dark days,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And absolutely, I felt like I was the most hated man in the world. I got death threats. People saying, they were going to come after me and my family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I still remember walking down the street in London a day or two later. I thought I was okay until I started looking over my shoulder. I was looking at people wondering if they were going to get me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi is only ready to tell his story now – and like most stories, his begins with a dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GROWING UP WITH A DREAM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi’s Formula One dream began on a dusty old racetrack in Western Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decrepit, derelict and eventually torn down, Oran Park could not have been further from the glitz and glamour of places like Monaco and Monza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I actually grew up wanting to be a chef,’ Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I even worked as a barman and waiter at a restaurant in Brighton Le Sands, but all that changed and realised that wanted to work in the sport that I loved my entire life</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi began his career in motorsport as a volunteer when he was 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My first job was in the Super Touring category,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stream all the action from the F1 Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend on Kayo. Pre-race coverage starts 9:30pm AEST on Sunday, with racing live from 11pm. New to Kayo? Try 14 days free now &gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did anything and everything they asked, but in truth I pretty much just carried sh** around and got coffees.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sound of engines, the smell of burning rubber, confirmed Masi’s love with the sport. He put away his apron and bought himself a pair of earplugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What I really love are the people,” Masi said. “And I loved the organisational side and the business side of it. There were all these super successful business people in the sport, which was their hobby. I learned as much as I could from them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi soon made the sport his business. A go-getter with a knack for getting things done, he rifled his way through the ranks. He went from Super Touring to Supercars. From Supercars to the Confederation of Australian Motorsport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that’s when the call that would change his life came.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DEPUTY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to 2018 and Masi was being groomed to become the next Supercars race director. He was sitting at a dinner in Adelaide on the eve of the Clipsal 500 when his phone rang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Oh,’ he said to his dinner guests, which included his mentor Tim Schenken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s Charlie Whiting. I better get this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whiting, of course, was the Formula One race director. Known by every Formula One fan, Whiting had been the sport’s chief official since 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was like ‘what is Charlie Whiting calling me for?’ Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But anyway I walked out and took the call and he asked me if I was interested in becoming one of his deputies. If I wanted to be his understudy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course he wanted to become his understudy. He had spent the last 22 years working his backside off to get his Formula One chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi had to pinch himself when he joined Whiting in the Formula One race control centre in Melbourne that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spent the rest of the year by Whiting‘s side, sitting in a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> like room full of screens, learning the ropes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He finished the year with nine races under his belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masterful Max, Ferrari brainfarts, why a mid-year break, Hungary for ice cream</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READY OR NOT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi was back in <b>Australia</b> at the beginning of 2019 for the Australian GP, which would be his first as a deputy race director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh-faced and raring to go, he walked into Whiting’s hotel at 7.15am ahead of an 8am briefing at the track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It got to 7.30am and Charlie had still not come down,“ Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We started calling him at 7.35am. He wasn’t answering, which was not normal because he always answered his phone. We raised the alarm with the hotel at about 7.45am.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi went numb when he saw the hotel staffer run across the lobby with a defibrillator. Masi was soon informed that his mentor had suffered a pulmonary embolism. Dead, age 66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was in complete shock,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had lost my mentor. My friend. The man that had given me my shot in Formula One.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Masi had to pull himself together. He had a race to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“FIA president Jean Todt just looked at me and said ‘Michael you are sitting in the deputy’s seat, so you will be the race director for this weekend.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of his shock new role, Masi was told he would have to brief the Formula One drivers ahead of the GP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yeah I was nervous,” Masi said. “I was watching them on TV one day and there I am addressing them the next. I had not met any of them. I didn’t know them and they most definitely did not know me. It was daunting but I think with what was going on, it was just another part of a very surreal week.“</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi still doesn’t know how he made it through the weekend – but he passed what was the most difficult of tests with flying colours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His talent as a race director was undeniable. So much so that he was appointed as Whiting’s official replacement following the flawless job he did as an interim director over the next nine rounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I loved it,” Masi said. “It really was my dream job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next 18 months, Masi did not only a five-star job as race director, but also helped the sport navigate its way through the global catastrophe which was <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming into the last race of the 2021 season – which just happened to be the most anticipated finale in Formula One history with Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen set to square off in a championship deciding fight – Masi’s future looked bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until lap 51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That‘s when it all went to hell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DECISION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercedes boss Toto Wolff picked up his headset and screamed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No Michael,” Wolff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No Michael. No. That was so not right. Michael … What was that? Michael, to race control. Michael you need to reinstate the lap before that is not right?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wolff’s driver, Lewis Hamilton, had just lost the Formula One world championship following what would become the most controversial decision in the history of the sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all began on lap 51 when a backmarker Nicholas Latifi crashed into a barrier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi called the safety car, as he should have. And seven laps later, when the track was clear, he resumed the race, which he also should have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Masi also made the decision to allow the five lapped cars that were between race leader Lewis Hamilton and second placed driver Verstappen to unlap themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not it was the right call is still being debated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either wrong or right, removing the lapped cars allowed Verstappen, who was on fresher tyres after pitting during the safety car period, to hunt down Hamilton and pass him to claim the world title.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It‘s fair to say Wolff thought the decision was wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outspoken Austrian told both Masi and the world as much when he protested the result on the live broadcast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both his tirade and Masi‘s response were beamed into the homes of 108 million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Toto, it’s called a motor race okay,” Masi replied over the radio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We went to car racing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi knew his decision would prove controversial – but he could not have foreseen what was to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would begin with death-threats and end with him losing his dream job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DEATH THREATS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi picked up his phone later that night. Amid talk of legal action from Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes and calls for his job, Masi wanted to reach out to his family and let them know he was okay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he was – at least until he got his first death threat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Thankfully, I don‘t have an <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> account,” Masi said. “Or <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. I don’t have any of that. Being old-school I do however have <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which I used to stay in touch with family and friends. I opened my messages that night to check in with them. I had no idea that I could receive them from people I did not know. But I was wrong. I was confronted with hundreds of messages. I wouldn’t say thousands but certainly hundreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And they were shocking. Racist, abusive, vile, they called me every name under the sun. And there were death threats. People saying, they were going to come after me and my family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And they kept on coming. Not just on my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> but also on my <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span>, which is supposed to be a professional platform for business. It was the same type of abuse.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi tried to dismiss the messages. He stopped reading them and attempted to put them out of his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At first, I just thought I would ignore it and get on with it because I knew it could take me to a very dark place,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I tried to cut myself off mentally, and I thought I could.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he couldn’t. In fact Masi could not even walk down the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I mostly kept it all to myself,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I told a few people but not many. I didn’t want to concern my family and friends. I didn’t want them worrying too. The FIA (Masi’s employers) knew but I think I downplayed it all to everyone including them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE AFTERMATH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi’s next three months were a living hell. The face of arguably the biggest controversy in F1 history, he was front page news across the globe. Hamilton and Mercedes had made him public enemy No. 1, calling for him to be sacked and threatening legal action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the death threats continued to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi returned to <b>Australia</b> and fought a private battle with his <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I didn’t want to talk to anyone,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not even family and friends. I only talked to my close family – but very briefly. I also lost my appetite. I have heard some people become binge eaters during times like this but I didn’t eat much. It did have a physical impact, but it was more mental. I just wanted to be in a bubble. I had no desire to talk to them. I just wanted to be alone, which was very challenging.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi put on a brave face and returned to work in January. He travelled to Saudi Arabia for a track inspection and did his best to ignore the storm that was still raging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, following a race director’s conference in Geneva, he was stood down on February 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It took me a while to process it all,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But at the end of the day I thought it was best for me to come back home and be close to my support network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I didn‘t go and talk to a professional. With the benefit of hindsight, I probably should have. I should have gone and spoken to someone in a professional sense. But in saying that, I had some amazing people around me that could see it and were checking in daily. I was super fortunate to have that support network.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi cannot talk about the decision he made in Abu Dhabi due to Non-Disclosure Agreements with the FIA – but he can talk about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The whole experience has made me a much stronger person,” Masi said. “I have just had the longest break in my professional career and I have used the time to reconnect with family and friends. I have also done all that self-maintenance which you can neglect when you are in the grind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have a number of exciting options going forward. I am considering a number of different projects, both domestic and globally. My intention is to base myself out of <b>Australia</b> and to use all the skills I have gained in what has been an incredible journey so far and one I am extremely proud and thankful for.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Kyle Chalmers wins the 100m freestyle gold medal at the Commonwealth Games it should go straight to the pool room next to his greatest accomplishments in swimming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing will ever top the gold medal he won for <b>Australia</b> at Rio in 2016, but if King Kyle is able to pull off a victory in Birmingham, that deserves to sit alongside his historic Olympic breakthrough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers has swum at bigger events than the Commonwealth Games, but has never faced the same level of scrutiny and turbulence that he’s endured this week, so a win would rank among the sweetest of his stellar career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Chalmers is also the only person capable of derailing what would be one of Australian swimming's most memorable gold medals, according to former Commonwealth Games swimmer turned broadcaster Johanna Griggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commentator, speaking on Sydney's Triple M Breakfast show, believes Chalmers is adding fuel to the narrative he is trying to squash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only person who is going to potentially derail - could be Kyle himself, he seems to be feeding it,” Griggs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Do I think they (the headlines) are affecting Emma McKeon? Absolutely not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can’t just expect the headlines to always be great. You have to accept that occasionally sometimes they’re going to be about other people and sometimes they might not necessarily show you in the same light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s the reality of sport. I’m kind of hoping that Kyle stops feeding it. I guess he’s feeling incredibly swamped at the moment and not coping with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every time he mentions it, he makes it a bigger story. Whatever it takes for him to do, I think he will calm down a lot.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing 1.94m tall and packed with muscles covered in ink, Chalmers is an imposing man in every sense, but he’s also been very open about the <b>mental health</b> issues he’s faced this past week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Chalmers storms to victory in his 100m freestyle semi-final.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An old-fashioned racer who leaves nothing in the tank whenever he dives in, he gave a harrowing insight into just how deeply hurt he says he’s been by his spat with the media, saying that he didn’t even want to start in his favourite race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s probably one of the biggest challenges I’ve had to face,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For me, it took all my courage and all my energy just to stand behind the blocks and swim”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who has seen Chalmers in action before — whether it’s in individual races or flying the flag for <b>Australia</b> in the relays — knows that he becomes a different beast the moment he hits the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He’s as ferocious as the Lion King tattoos on his bulging arms and he proved that yet again by posting a blistering time of 47.36 seconds to win his semi-final.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his post-race interview, swim champ Cate Campbell referred to his tattoo and the bravery he showed in putting down such a performance just hours after a public blow-up about the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emphatic win was like a giant up-yours to his critics and his doubters — and now he just has to repeat the performance in the final.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Chalmers takes a moment after winning his semi-final. Picture: Michael Klein</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers’ time was the second fastest by anyone in the world this year and would have won him the gold medal at last month’s world championships in Budapest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more than that, it was a statement swim — a message to his supporters that he’s out of his cage and back on the prowl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t have anything else to say, it’s rough,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been a whirlwind. It’s nice to swim fast. I think it’s easy to put on a brave face and smile. It’s hard, it’s very hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve had three heart surgeries, I have a chain that is broken because my heart was holding me back and now it’s fixed. So yeah, that’s a special one for me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the Australian team, watching from the stands, went bananas when Chalmers climbed out of the pool, beaming after what he said was the toughest 24 hours of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had all rallied around him after he revealed how upset he was and the Big Tuna said it was their support that helped get him through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The team has been amazing,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just wanted to put my headphones on and switch off and not talk, (but) all of my teammates, coaches and staff coming up and saying they are there for me has been really special. I wouldn’t have been able to get through it without my teammates.“I’m not a robot. We have feelings, we have emotions, we’re no different than anyone else. We struggle a lot, <b>mental health</b> is a huge thing in sport.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHALMERS: IT’S HARD FOR ME TO STAND UP AND SWIM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Jacquelin Magnay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Chalmers revealed it took all of his courage and energy to turn up for the heats of the men’s 100m freestyle at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games after a tumultuous few days as some experienced former swimmers have expressed concern about his <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Olympic champion had just finished second in his heat, recording a time of 48.98 to progress to the semi finals, when he made an emotional outpouring on television and then to the press in the mixed zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers, the fastest swimmer in the team said “I feel safe” when he is standing on the blocks with some of the his training partners and close swim mates. He said he had spoken to his brother to get through a tough time, and was also taking heart from the support from his training partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ I love the guys I get to race against, I love the guys…the guys that I love and guys that motivate me in standing on the blocks next to (defending Commonwealth games champion) Duncan (Scott), it helps me feel a little bit more safe having a mate next to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BKyle Chalmers flies off the blocks in the 100m freestyle heats. Picture: Michael Klein</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olympic superstar Ian Thorpe said Chalmers doesn’t feel as though he is in control of the narrative around his own story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The things that I have read and saying that you’re at breaking point, rock bottom kind of area, this is concerning,’’ said Thorpe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cate Campbell, who interviewed Chalmers on Channel 7 said “Kyle sometimes uses the things that are said about him to fuel that fire within him, but it might have now reached a breaking point where there’s too much pile-on.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers has been in the middle of a media storm, which started on day one of the Games when he didn’t congratulate his team mate and former girlfriend Emma McKeon immediately after their gold medal success in the mixed relay. That apparent tension was diffused by both swimmers who said there were some positive words spoken later on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after spraying the media after the record breaking efforts of the mens 4x100m relay on day two, Chalmers then said on Channel 7 that “It is hard to get up and swim this morning. It’s probably one of the biggest challenges I’ve had to face. I think media the impact it has on athletes and <b>mental health</b>. For me it took all my courage and all my energy just to stand behind the blocks and swim this morning.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers said it took great strength to stand up and swim after fiery press conference the night before. Picture: Michael Klein</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “It is not something that I wanted to do, it’s not something that I wanted to go through, to be honest with you, I’ve been so excited for this moment for such a long period of time and been working hard to be here for such a long time. For how it’s unfolded, yeah, definitely makes me question my future in the sport.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers insisted that there was no conflict within the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As much as the media want to make up, there is conflict on the team, there is zero, we’re such a tight team, as you know, we’ve been away for such a long time now we are like brothers and sisters. I enjoy being part of the team, I enjoy being a Senior part of the team.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metros Comm Games MT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thorpe said that he hoped the furore would die down to help Chalmers <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When he says he’s almost at breaking point it’s almost as though it’s the straw that broke the camel’s back,’’ said Thorpe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don’t know the back story. Kyle has spoken about struggles he’s had with <b>mental health</b>. I have done a similar thing as well and know a lot of athletes do go through this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hope it can quieten down for him because we’re looking at the priorities in all of this. Number one is his <b>mental health</b>. Then the second part of it is we want him to perform well and then the third part of it is working out what the relationship with the media looks like,” Thorpe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIERY POOLSIDE BLOW-UP TO GALVANISE SWIM TEAM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Julian Linden</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Day two of the Commonwealth Games swim meet started like any other — but it ended in two massive team gold medals and a fiery press conference with its star swimmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may well be the flashpoint that reunites the Australian swim team’s Games’ campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two days of speculation of a rift in the team, the Dolphins responded the best way it knows how — by winning races in record time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then Kyle Chalmers blew-up at the post-race press conference accusing the media of making up stories about troubles in the team and his apparent snub of his ex-girlfriend and relay teammate Emma McKeon. In emotional outbursts at the conference and later on his social media accounts, Chalmers denied there was a rift and spoke about the pressures the coverage was having on the team. “We win almost every single medal last night and again tonight and that’s the storyline. I think the media really need to start to grow up and focus on the good things,” he said at the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Chalmers following the men’s victory in the 4x100m freestyle final. Picture: <span class="companylink">AAP</span> Image/Dave Hunt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And later on his social media: “I don’t know how many more times it needs to be said by not only me but my fellow teammates, but these fake storyline’s are doing more harm than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have dedicated my life to this sport and representing my country. I am your poster boy from 2016 and I’m your villain in 2022. And for no reason other than some people in the media needing to justify their pay cheques and knowing that false headlines create clicks and earn them money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But do you know what it does to the humans you write about? It breaks them down little by little, and tonight is the breaking point. Up until this point I’ve tried to just keep on moving forward but tonight I ask that you please stop writing these false headlines otherwise my time in the sport will be finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ I don’t swim for this, I didn’t get into the sport to have to deal with this. I swim to inspire and I swim because I love my sport and it gives me purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No matter what I do these days, the media wants to jump on when I have done nothing but give all to this country. I stand and talk to you guys after every race. Bad, good, I’ve always stopped to give you guys the time of day.</p>

                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s going to be a time when I definitely stop doing that if that’s going to be the case. I said exactly what I needed to do last night, I did the race, we won gold, everyone won gold and focused on the positives.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was supported on social media by other swimmers last night, including another of his exes Madi Wilson, who warned about the impact the coverage would have on the <b>mental health</b> of the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Tonight I sat on the bus with 5 other Commonwealth Games gold medallists, all deflated. We need to be more aware that we are people,” Wilson wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some of the lines of questioning is hurting my teammates and enough is enough.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, EIijah Winnington also defended Chalmers, denying there was a split in the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All this hype over the love triangle and all that I think it’s just hype,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s nothing like that actually in the team. And that’s I guess the unfortunate thing is because, you know, lies are getting spread when it’s not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Chalmers on the pool deck in Birmingham. . Picture: Michael Klein</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t think it’s about that. I think it’s just more saving respect for Cody (Simpson), I think if Kyle had have done either which way he would have been painted as the bad guy. So I mean, I think it’s just a tough situation to be in. You know, we’ve all had exes in the past and we’ve all we’ve never really had to them work with the colleague of the new boyfriend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s definitely no tension and it’s amicable if anything on the team so it’s just a shame that it’s getting painted out that way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is understood angry Australian officials and team leaders met after the session to console swimmers and events of the night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The were discussions that some swimmers may refuse some interviews after the races.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The controversy may also have a huge bearing on whether the Dolphins can repeat their stunning success from last year’s stunning success at the Tokyo Olympics in two years’ time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers may think this current storm is all about him, but it’s really about the entire Australian team because these are the flashpoint moments that either unite or divide the squad. There’s always been dramas and rifts within Australian swimming but the fortunes of the team always come down to how they respond to adversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early signs suggest this latest soap opera is already having a galvanising effect on the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Chalmers came out swinging, the response from the rest of the team was magnificent as they blew the opposition apart to win gold medals in both the men’s and women’s relays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big bear hugs he shared with his teammates on the pool deck – and the comments by other team members all suggest they publicly have his back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b> celebrating their 4x100m freestyle win. Picture: Andy Buchanan / AFP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swimmers may not see it right now, but the pressure they’re feeling in Birmingham is nothing to what they’ll be under in Paris in 2024 but it’s a great test of their resolve because nothing decides the fate of teams more than when the chips are down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accused in the past of being pampered poodles, in London in 2012 and again in Rio in 2016, things quickly unravelled at the first sign of trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Tokyo last year, in the midst of a global <b>pandemic</b> where they had every excuse in the world to underperform, the Dolphins toughed it out and reaped the rewards – winning a record nine Olympic gold medals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After London and Rio, that could have killed the team’s vibe forever, but it strengthened it and the same thing is happening now in Birmingham. This Dolphins team is too good to be knocked off course by one prominent member believing the media has it in for him, when they don’t. The truth is, Chalmers is actually a media favourite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers is threatening to walk away from swimming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian team hopes he doesn’t because he still has a lot to offer the sport, both as a competitor and a team leader, but with a new wave of youngsters snapping at his heels what happens next will be up to him, not the media.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRIVATE health insurers saved money on surgery during <b>Covid</b> but <b>mental health</b> claims surged by almost 14 per cent as lockdowns took a devastating toll on young women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health fund data shows high-cost <b>mental health</b> claims soared by 13.7 per cent among the under-30 age group in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three in four of the claimants were women and they spent an average of a month in private mental facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychiatry and acute <b>mental health</b> care is now the top service used by privately insured heath fund members under the age of 59, up from second place in 2018-19, the study released by <span class="companylink">Private Healthcare <b>Australia</b></span> shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third of young people with high <b>mental health</b> claims (above $10,000) received hospital treatment for depressive disorders and one in five had anxiety disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in eight had an eating disorder and one in 10 had other mental and substance use disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHA chief executive Rachel David said the high-cost <b>mental health</b> claims proved that health cover was of value to younger people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s quite clear that the impact of long-term lockdowns without any certainty about where they were going to end has hit younger people particularly hard,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’re talking about people at a very vulnerable stage of their development.” A Liptember Foundation survey found an alarming one in five girls in their teenage years experienced eating disorders and suicide/self harm at rates more than double the normal population.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WORLD EXCLUSIVE From Fairfield to F1 ... and his fall from grace THE Australian who made the most controversial decision in Formula One history and cost Lewis Hamilton the world title has broken his seven month silence to reveal he feared for his life in the wake of the bombshell call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an exclusive interview with The Sunday Telegraph, former race director Michael Masi has admitted he was scared to walk down the street after he was bombarded with death threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raised in his grandmother’s four-bedroom home in Fairfield, the Western Sydney boy who scored his dream job as F1’s top steward became the “most hated man in the world” when he imposed a penalty on Hamilton during the title-deciding race in ­December last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were some dark days,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And absolutely, I felt like I was the most hated man in the world. I got death threats. People saying they were going to come after me and my family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I still remember walking down the street in London a day or two later. I was looking at people wondering if they were going to get me.” Masi is only ready to tell his story now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DREAM It began at Oran Park, a dusty old racetrack that was pulled down and was a world away from the glitz and glamour of places like Monaco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I actually grew up wanting to be a chef,’ Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then he began to volunteer in motorsport when he was 16. “I did anything and everything they asked, but in truth I pretty much just carried shit around and got coffees,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sound of engines, the smell of burning rubber, confirmed Masi’s love with the sport. He put away his apron and bought himself earplugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What I really love are the people,” Masi said. “And I loved the organisational side and the business side of it. There were all these super successful business people in the sport, which was their hobby. I learned as much as I could from them.” Masi soon made the sport his business. He went from Super Touring to Supercars to the Confederation of Australian Motorsport. And that’s when the call that would change his life came.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DEPUTY In 2018 Masi was being groomed to become the next Supercars race director. He was sitting at a dinner in Adelaide on the eve of the Clipsal 500 when his phone rang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oh,” he said to his guests, which included his mentor Tim Schenken. “It’s Charlie Whiting. I better get this.” Whiting was the Formula One race director and had been the sport’s chief official since 1988. “He asked me if I was interested in becoming one of his deputies. If I wanted to be his understudy.” Masi had to pinch himself when he joined Whiting in the Formula One race control centre in Melbourne that year. He finished the year with nine races under his belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READY OR NOT Masi was back in <b>Australia</b> at the beginning of 2019 for the Australian GP, which would be his first as a deputy race director. He walked into Whiting’s hotel at 7.15am ahead of an 8am briefing at the track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It got to 7.30am and Charlie had still not come down,” Masi said. “We raised the alarm with the hotel about 7.45am.” Masi saw the hotel staffer run across the lobby with a defibrillator. Masi was soon informed that his mentor had suffered a pulmonary embolism. Dead, age 66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was in complete shock,” Masi said. “I had lost my mentor. My friend. The man that had given me my shot in ­Formula One.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“FIA president Jean Todt just looked at me and said: ‘Michael you are sitting in the deputy’s seat, so you will be the race director for this weekend’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi was told he would have to brief the Formula One drivers ahead of the GP. “Yeah I was nervous,” Masi said. “I was watching them on TV one day and there I am addressing them the next. I had not met any of them. I didn’t know them and they most definitely did not know me. It was daunting but I think with what was going on, it was just another part of a very surreal week.” Masi still doesn’t know how he made it through the weekend but he passed what was the most difficult of tests with flying colours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was appointed as Whiting’s official replacement following the flawless job he did as an interim director over the next nine rounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I loved it,” Masi said. “It really was my dream job.” Over the next 18 months, Masi did not only a five-star job as race director but also helped the sport navigate its way through the global catastrophe that was <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming into the last race of the 2021 season – the most anticipated finale in Formula One history with Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen to square off in a championship deciding fight – Masi’s future looked bright. Until lap 51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DECISION MERCEDES boss Toto Wolff picked up his headset and screamed. “No Michael. No Michael. No. That was so not right. Michael … What was that?” Wolff’s driver, Lewis Hamilton, had just lost the world championship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began on lap 51 when Nicholas Latifi crashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi called the safety car, as he should have. And seven laps later, when the track was clear, he resumed the race, which he also should have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Masi also made the decision to allow the five lapped cars that were between race leader Lewis Hamilton and second-placed driver Verstappen to unlap themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not it was the right call is still being debated. Either wrong or right, ­removing the lapped cars allowed Verstappen, who was on fresher tyres after pitting during the safety car period, to hunt down Hamilton and pass him to claim the world title.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously Wolff thought the decision was wrong. The outspoken German told both Masi and the world as much when he protested the result on the live broadcast. Both his tirade and Masi’s response were beamed into millions of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Toto, it’s called a motor race okay,” Masi replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We went to car racing.” Masi knew his decision would prove controversial but he could not have foreseen what was to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would begin with death threats and end with him losing his dream job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DEATH THREATS Masi picked up his phone later that night. Amid talk of legal action from Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes and calls for his job, Masi wanted to reach out to his family and let them know he was okay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he was – until he got his first death threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Thankfully, I don’t have an <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> account,” Masi said. “Or <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. I don’t have any of that. Being old-school I do however have <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which I used to stay in touch with family and friends. I opened my messages that night to check in with them. I was confronted with hundreds of messages. I wouldn’t say thousands but certainly hundreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And they were shocking. Racist, abusive, vile, they called me every name under the sun. And there were death threats. People saying they were going to come after me and my family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And they kept on coming. Not just on my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> but also on my <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span>.” Masi tried to dismiss the messages. He stopped reading them and attempted to put them out of his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At first, I just thought I would ignore it and get on with it because I knew it could take me to a very dark place,” Masi said. “I tried to cut myself off mentally, and I thought I could.” But he couldn’t. In fact Masi could not even walk down the street. “I mostly kept it all to myself,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I told a few people but not many. I didn’t want to concern my family and friends. I didn’t want them worrying too. The FIA (Masi’s employers) knew but I think I downplayed it all to everyone, including them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE AFTERMATH Masi’s next three months were a living hell. The face of arguably the biggest controversy in F1 history, he was front page news across the globe. Hamilton and Mercedes had made him public enemy No.1, calling for him to be sacked and threatening legal action. And the death threats continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masi returned to <b>Australia</b> and fought a private battle with his <b>mental health</b>. “I didn’t want to talk to anyone,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not even family and friends. I only talked to my close family – but very briefly. I also lost my appetite. I have heard some people become binge eaters during times like this but I didn’t eat much. It did have a physical impact, but it was more mental. I just wanted to be in a bubble. I had no desire to talk to them. I just wanted to be alone, which was very challenging.” Masi put on a brave face and returned to work in January. But, following a race ­director’s conference in ­Geneva, he was stood down on February 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It took me a while to process it all,” Masi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought it was best for me to come back home and be close to my support network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I didn’t go and talk to a professional. With the benefit of hindsight, I probably should have. I should have gone and spoken to someone in a professional sense. But in saying that, I had some amazing people around me that could see it and were checking in daily. I was super fortunate to have that support network.” Masi cannot talk about the decision he made in Abu Dhabi due to Non-Disclosure Agreements with the FIA but he can talk about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The whole experience has made me a much stronger person,” Masi said. “I have a number of exciting options going forward. My intention is to base myself out of <b>Australia</b> and to use all the skills I have gained in what has been an incredible journey so far and one I am extremely proud and thankful for.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRIVATE health insurers saved money on surgery during <b>Covid</b> but <b>mental health</b> claims surged by almost 14 per cent as lockdowns took a devastating toll on young women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health fund data shows high-cost <b>mental health</b> claims soared by 13.7 per cent among the under-30 age group in 2021. Three in four claimants were women and they spent an average of a month in private mental facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychiatry and acute <b>mental health</b> care is now the top service used by privately insured health fund members under 59, up from second place in 2018-19, the <span class="companylink">Private Healthcare <b>Australia</b></span> study shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third of young people with high <b>mental health</b> claims (above $10,000) received hospital treatment for depressive disorders and one in five had anxiety disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in eight had eating disorders and one in 10 had other mental and substance disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHA chief executive Rachel David said young people were prevented from face-to-face interactions, lost the chance to celebrate milestones, could not play sport or do performing arts, and endless TikTok videos on weight loss probably fuelled eating disorders. A Liptember Foundation survey found an alarming one in five girls in their teenage years experienced eating disorders and suicide/self harm at rates more than double the normal population.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether co-hosting breakfast television with Kylie Gillies on The Morning Show or ushering people into the evening with The Chase <b>Australia</b> game show, Larry Emdur is in his element, chatting to celebrities and everyday Aussies with equal enthusiasm. Now, with the release of his memoir Happy As, he shares his most treasured family tales and behind-the-scenes secrets. Reflecting on his enduring career, Emdur tells Stellar, “I’ve had this outrageously lucky run”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you ask anyone on television what led them to pursue a career in front of the camera, they will more than likely refer back to their performance in a state debating competition or a lucky break they got after journalism school..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not Larry Emdur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he tells it in his new memoir, the road to becoming “a fully fledged, card-carrying, self-centred, egomaniacal TV wanker” began in primary school and not on speech day, but in the annual marching parade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up against girls trained in “physie” and boys who had consulted books on how to march, nine-year-old Emdur figured he could nail it by practising in front of the mirror and ensuring his socks stayed up. To that end, his mum knotted elastic into a pair of garters and little Larry focused on straightening his thumbs so they didn’t look like “two little undercooked frankfurters blowing in the breeze”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a man who would later place fifth on Dancing With The Stars, it was a pivotal moment. Had he not gone on to win the Rose Bay Public School marching parade trophy – having survived loss of circulation in his legs and lactic acid build-up in his thumbs – we may, he points out, have been spared 40 years of his mug on the telly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s when I realised this was where I always wanted to be,” Emdur tells Stellar. “The centre of attention, with everyone looking at me.” As much as Happy As is – true to its title – Emdur’s laugh-out-loud chronicle of his four decades in television, the book also serves as a sepia-toned recollection of a time when childhoods were long and families were everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We weren’t poor, but we never had huge amounts of money or resources, yet we never missed out on anything,” says Emdur, 57, whose evocations of suburban life in Sydney’s Bondi Beach with a mum and dad who loved him fiercely go some way to explaining his longevity in the TV industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Be nice to everyone,” his father David would constantly tell him. Meanwhile, his mum Faye pinned ribbons and certificates on the family corkboard and celebrated even the most minor achievements by placing her hand over her heart and whispering to Emdur and his sisters, “I love you. I’m so proud of you.” While Emdur points out that her pride was occasionally misplaced – his first job was stapling pizza boxes together and his second job only lasted a day after he gave away too many ice creams to his mates – he credits the simplicity of his upbringing for keeping his ego in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve never taken it too seriously,” he says, expressing gratitude that 15 years at the helm of <span class="companylink">Seven Network</span>’s The Morning Show along with a high-profile role hosting The Chase <b>Australia</b> have kept him so busy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve had this outrageously lucky run,” he says, talking to Stellar from his new apartment where wall-to-wall glass offers a panoramic view of Sydney Harbour. “Sometimes I’ve gone from one network to the other just a day after my contract has finished and that’s really unusual. The only thing I can really put that down to is I’ve tried not to be a diva or a nasty person. I’ve always been polite where possible; that’s the only real constant. Because it’s certainly not talent.” While his career was built on successes such as The Price Is Right, Emdur also had duds, notably The Main Event and Family Double Dare, which he says was axed after one episode. As he adds, he learnt quickly that while he “can care to the point of a heart attack” about some jobs, decisions are largely made way above his head. “I learnt early to chill out and I found that the less I cared about things, the more often they came,” he says. “Only foolish people rely on TV. It’s such a dangerous place and the tide changes so quickly.” That’s why he worries about reality-show contestants who buy into the hype and counsels them to carefully manage their moment. “If you develop an ego in the [television] environment, you’re dead in the water,” he explains. “I’ve seen egomaniacs and narcissists, I’ve seen them crash and burn pretty quick. People hate them and talk about them behind their back.” While the father of two has embraced <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>, the platform where he has 157,000 followers, Happy As goes back to an era before social media and cancel culture, a time when mistakes at work were more likely regarded as part of the learning rather than grounds for an apology or sacking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emdur relates how, upon being sent to interview Michael Chamberlain, the father exonerated in the death of his nine-week-old baby Azaria, he had unwittingly referred to himself by a title he’d been given because of his talent for covering fluffy animal stories. “It turns out, introducing yourself as ‘The Dog Reporter’ to a man whose baby was taken by a dingo is not the greatest way to build a rapport,” he recalls dryly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s the time he missed Queen Elizabeth II emerging on the Royal Yacht Britannia because he was too busy looking at bikini-clad girls on the Brisbane River, or the occasion in which he had flown to New York to conduct an interview with John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, but his sole preparation had amounted to reading author Albert Goldman’s unflinching 1988 biography The Lives Of John Lennon, which he’d picked up in the airport bookshop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ono refused to answer questions about the book, proclaiming it “rubbish”, he was forced to wing it. Emdur suspects she felt sorry for him and ended up giving him one of his best ever interviews. “She said to me afterwards that I reminded her of her son,” he recalls. “She saw a boy doing a man’s job and she just played along for whatever reason.” Compare that to the controversy that ensued when his Seven colleague Matt Doran issued an apology to Adele last November, and had to explain to viewers why he hadn’t listened to her new album before an exclusive interview, and you understand why Emdur is grateful he got his start when he did. Yet part of Emdur’s charm is treating superstars as ordinary people, like when he invited a newly famous Jason Donovan over to his family home to go for a surf. His parents chatted away to their son’s new friend despite having no idea who he was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Happy As – the title was suggested by Emdur’s primary school mate, Robbie – gives an insight into celebrity antics, its most heartwarming stories are anchored in family life. There’s the seduction of and grand marriage proposal to Sylvie, his Polish-born wife of 28 years; his childhood eating pies and hanging out on a boat with his dad; Puberty Blues-style surf (and sex) culture; and the growing realisation that his dad’s smoking was eventually going to kill him. “Reading back over the book, if I’m not stealing something, I’m crying,” says Emdur, who adds that his father’s death in 2004 hit him hard and led him to encourage others to stop smoking and to campaign for the Raise Foundation. “It was a turning point where I realised it’s OK to open up,” he says. “It’s something I hadn’t considered much because my life has been very jazz-handsy and game-show host.” Having taken up meditation to manage the increased work demands of The Chase, Emdur applied the techniques to the writing of his book last summer. He’d rise at 4am at his holiday property and write solidly all day, pausing only for a quick swim. Despite leaving school without his HSC – and with a loose relationship with punctuation – he enjoyed the process. He recounts how he contacted one old girlfriend after re-reading the love letters she’d sent him, to which he’d never responded. “I wasn’t being nasty, I was just a boy and with my old-man glasses on and being the father of a daughter, it wasn’t good enough,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing he believes he has done well, however, is offer his children the same sense of calm he enjoyed growing up. Jye, 28, and Tia, 23, have now moved out of home, but he recently honoured his family with a new tattoo, a heart intersected with three arrows. Sylvie, he says, has been his rock, sticking with him through periods of unemployment and being understanding even when she was eight months pregnant with a broken leg while he was in Melbourne surrounded by bikini models on The Price Is Right. It’s clear, however, that she shares his sense of humour, with an effusive comment leading the endorsements on the opening page of his book. “Oh look, it’s very sweet,” reads her review, “but you’re not going to win a Pulitzer.” While Emdur’s memoir is full of wit, it’s also a reminder of less complicated days before the explosion of stress and <b>mental-health</b> issues. “My sister is an adolescent psychologist and she’s so busy with issues that just weren’t around for our generation,” he says. “My mum knew how to manage sunburn, but how do you manage stress and anxiety?” He’s also aware from hosting daily television through the several years of bushfires, floods and the upheaval of a <b>pandemic</b> that “no-one has escaped misery in the last couple of years”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, Emdur says, why he’s always looking to give viewers a laugh.“I look forward,” he says, tempering his optimism by noting that it’s a pretty easy thing for him to say as he sits in front of a cheese platter. “I just try to brighten things up, whether that’s on The Morning Show or The Chase. That’s what my dad always told me: to look for the lighter side, wherever you can.” Happy As: Stories Of Summer, Childhood And The Magic Of Family by Larry Emdur (<span class="companylink">HarperCollins</span>, $34.99) is out Wednesday</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Chalmers led <b>Australia</b> to a record-breaking relay victory before being rushed out of a media conference after he was asked about the reported rift in the Australian team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multiple Birmingham Commonwealth Games gold medal winner refused to be silenced though, later taking to <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> to hit out at reports of friction for the second time within a few hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following <b>Australia</b>’s convincing win in the 4x100m relay, Chalmers was asked if there was a rift between himself and Cody Simpson, who is now dating Chalmers’ ex-partner and fellow swimmer Emma McKeon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question followed reports Chalmers had snubbed McKeon after they combined to win gold in the 4x100m mixed relay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s all just false news,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s actually just crap. Like it’s honestly a load of sh** that’s not true. Just words getting put out and you wanting to make a story of nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I said congratulations and we (McKeon) stood here right alongside you guys and spoke last night. I find that really hard to believe that I didn’t say congratulations after the race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I actually walked up and said ‘good job’ across the pool. We all said congratulations, we all did what we had to do and it’s an honour to be part of that team last night and win the first gold medal in the race at the Commonwealth Games and to do it with <b>Australia</b>’s most successful Olympian and now <b>Australia</b>’s most successful Commonwealth Games athlete is special.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers said the drama was adding to his mental stress and threatened to give up swimming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The media really need to start to grow up and focus on the good things. I think every other country managed to do it,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No matter what I do these days, the media wants to jump on when I have done nothing but give all to this country. I stand and talk to you guys after every race. Bad, good, I’ve always stopped to give you guys the time of day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s going to be a time when I definitely stop doing that if that’s going to be the case. I said exactly what I needed to do last night. I did the race, we won gold, everyone won gold and focused on the positives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The truth is I won’t be around forever and you enjoy it while you can. You can try and bring me down all you want but it’s only going to last so long and I will stop talking to the media.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalmers was also quizzed about his relationship with Simpson, who is part of his first Australian team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: “I say ‘good luck’ to Cody. I say ‘good job’ to Cody. I send him a message after the race. I do nothing but be positive. I try and support him on the team but again, people just want clickbait.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Chalmers was asked to further clarify the situation with McKeon, <span class="companylink">Swimming <b>Australia</b></span> media manager Kieran Marsh interrupted and refused to allow him to answer the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hours later he took to his personal <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> account, saying he was at “breaking point.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Up until this point I’ve tried to just keep on moving forward but tonight I ask that you please stop writing these false headlines otherwise my time in the sport will be finished,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t swim for this, I didn’t get into the sport to have to deal with this. I swim to inspire and I swim because I love my sport and it gives me purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This could end my time in swimming, I hope you are all aware. My <b>mental health</b> right now from all of this over the months is at rock bottom, I really hope that pleases the keyboard warriors that continue to write false news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Thank you again for the people who love, care and support me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’ve been there for me every day through this journey.. and without you I would not have been standing here racing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would have been retired, but you motivated me, inspired me and helped me get through this battle. For that I am forever grateful.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIRST WORLD RECORD FALLS TO AUSSIE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katja Dedekind flew off the block and didn’t stop until she touched the wall - claiming gold and the first world record at the aquatics centre these Games - only she didn’t even know she had done it until after she got out the pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dedekind, who is blind in her right eye and has limited vision in her left, couldn’t see the results board after the S13 50m freestyle - only learning of her impressive time when talking to media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She touched in at 26.56 seconds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m pretty happy with that, it’s better than my times at Worlds, better than I’ve been doing at training,” Dedekind said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I couldn’t be more stoked. I feel like I’m only just acquiring all the knowledge I can get.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After adding two bronze medals to her growing collection in Tokyo Dedekind changed coaches and moved to the Sunshine Coast to train with USC Spartans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is just the beginning,” she said. “I thought Worlds was my best time I could do, if it was I would have been happy, so to be a Commonwealth Games champion, get a world record - stoked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have worlds next year, Paris in two years - I just want to make sure I get to Paris.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decorated swimmer made her Paralympic debut in Rio where she won bronze in the S13 100m backstroke and reached the final of the S13 400m freestyle finishing seventh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fellow Aussie Kirralee Hayes finished third and Jenna Jones wasn’t far behind her in fourth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the men’s S13 50m freestyle final a bronze medal at his first Commonwealth Games has Jacob Templeton hungry to keep his swimming career alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Templeton put up a tough fight in the field of five in the men’s S13 50m freestyle race to earn his place on the podium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 27-year-old Tasmanian hasn’t taken to the pool in an international event for almost four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s hard to know how to react when you’re in the pool and you don’t know how you wound up,” Templeton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The lead-up has been really hard, in 2019 I missed out on the championships and I qualified for the Games but I wasn’t chosen so it’s been four years since my last international event.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Templeton said he was taking his career one year at a time but felt he still had more to give.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m taking it one year at a time,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Having that sort of result definitely makes me want to come back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To motivate myself I do like to look back at the things that cause the heartbreak or the disappointment, moments like tonight - I wanted to win the gold, I’m really happy with the bronze, but I like to use that to keep me humble.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sticking close to the village and the aquatics centre Templeton said he was loving his first Commonwealth Games experience - the only multi-sport event where para-athletes compete alongside able-bodied athletes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They call these the friendly games and it really is,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I haven’t been able to get out and about but I’m a big fan of the coffee machine in the village and the flapjacks, we don’t have flapjacks in <b>Australia</b>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>AUSTRALIA</b>’S unsung Olympic hero Chelsea Hodges fought back tears as she finally got her own individual reward when she won a bronze medal in the women’s 50 metres breaststroke at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hodges swam the race of her life to help <b>Australia</b> win a record ninth gold medal in Tokyo last year but has fallen on tough times since - missing out in the team for last month’s world championships in Budapest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battling depression, she almost quit the sport but battled on and made the team for Birmingham where she unleashed a devastating final burst to get her hands on the wall in the nick of time and win the bronze medal in a time of 30.05 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s very exciting. The past 12 months have been really hard, I struggled getting back in the pool,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I almost retired from swimming and it took a lot to come back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gold medal went to South Africa’s South Africa’s Lara van Niekerk and the silver to England’s Imogen Clark in a blanket finish where all eight finalists were separated by just 1.66 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>’s Jenna Strauch (fifth) and Abbey Harkin (seventh) also made the final but finished out of the medals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hodges swam the breaststroke leg for the Australian team that won the gold in Tokyo by a fingernail from the United States, teaming up with Kaylee McKeown, Emma McKeon and Cate Campbell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hodges swam the breaststroke leg for the Australian team that won the gold in Tokyo by a fingernail from the United States, teaming up with Kaylee McKeown, Emma McKeon and Cate Campbell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still just 21, Hodges suffered a confidence-rattling setback this year when Strauch and Harkin beat her for the two places on the Aussie team for the world titles but said it was a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not making the worlds was the best thing that ever happened to me,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I fell in love with the sport again. My family have been my rock and to have their support has been so amazing.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SMITH JUSTIFIES COACH SWAP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unheralded Aussie Brendon Smith can look back at his silver medal winning swim in one of the toughest events on the Commonwealth Games program, the 400m individual medley, knowing he made the right decision to swap coaches and states after the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smith tailed the New Zealander Lewis Clareburt for the entire Games final, and despite a powerful 16 beat kick in the freestyle leg was unable to make much headway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, on the other side of the pool in lane one, the Scottish swimmer Duncan Scott was edging closer. Scott had, just an hour before, won the 200m freestyle final, and buoyed by that victory was steaming home. But his packed program may have helped Smith’s cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the touch Clareburt won in 4min08.70, a Commonwealth and championship record, with Smith just behind in 4min10.25, a full second ahead of Scott. Australian Se-Bom Lee, who had maintained fourth place for much of the race, tailed at the end to finish fifth. Another Australian Kieren Pollard was sixth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after hitting the headlines at the Tokyo Olympics, Smith, 22, was forced to leave his Nunawading base where he had flirted with open water swimming and surf lifesaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His long time coach Scott Talbot had agreed to a British contract after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and was already on the other side of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Games were postponed Nunawading deputy Wayne Lawes stepped in for 12 months to oversee the Olympic training during the <b>covid</b> restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Smith hit the headlines for his superb bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, the first medal in that event at an Olympics since Rob Woodhouse, Smith moved to Queensland. But the biggest impact of the move was meeting his partner, Kaylee McKeown.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elijah Winnington has erased all of the horror of the Tokyo Olympics with superb back-to-back freestyle races at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winnington, 22, won bronze in the 200m freestyle, finishing behind the Tokyo Olympic gold and silver medallists Duncan Scott of Scotland and Tom Dean of England on Sunday morning. Winnington’s bronze medal adds to his gold medal triumph in the 400m on the opening night of competition and importantly he has shown he can back up after collecting a world title at Budapest in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After the 400m I was extremely tired, I didn’t think it would be that slow to make the final and that’s what’s hard about being in the first seeded heat, you have no idea how fast you have to go.” He said he knew he could come home hard “because that’s the way I train”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Queenslander has rediscovered the strong form that he had shown in early 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the <b>Covid</b>-restricted environs of the delayed Olympics, Winnington struggled with his taper and the pressure of the big time and he finished seventh in the 400m final and 22nd in the 200m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet here in Birmingham, an older and wiser and far more confident Winnington has managed to double up from the 400m, getting home close to midnight and then backing up for the 200m heats and the final, all within 24 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winnington bristled at claims some of the Australians were a little sluggish with their times because of the hectic programming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t know that sluggish is the right word. I mean Mollie O’Callaghan beat what time she did at the worlds, I wouldn’t call that sluggish and you know Emma (McKeon) swum unbelievably in her first meet back so I don’t really know what you’re talking about,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BACKSTROKER’S BONUS BRONZE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central Coast swimmer Bradley Woodward has snared a bronze medal in the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 100m backstroke, an event he was added to at the last minute when the Australian champion Isaac Cooper was sent home from the pre-Games training camp in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woodward, 24, took the most of his unexpected opportunity and steamed home in the last 20m to touch in third place behind South African teenager Pieter Coetze and England’s Brodie Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The near blanket finish meant the field all touched within less than a second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woodward had won the silver medal in the same event at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, but for these Games he had been targeting the longer 200m backstroke distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His endurance showed at the tail end of the race when he overhauled three spots to grab third place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Cooper, who said his wellbeing and <b>mental health</b> resulted in him being sent home, would have learned of the results with some dismay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooper had been one of the favourites for the gold medal, having a time that ranked him number one in the Commonwealth in both the 50m and 100m backstroke races.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 18 year old posted on social media: “I’ve had to undergo a lot of self-reflection and examination. The decision made to send me home was based on my behaviour and <b>mental health</b> and was made in my best interest and that of the team competing at the Commonwealth Games.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backstroke veteran Mitch Larkin was 7th and youngster Joshua Edwards-Smith was eighth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private health insurers saved money on surgery during <b>Covid</b> but <b>mental health</b> claims surged by almost 14 per cent as lockdowns took a devastating toll on young women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health fund data shows high cost <b>mental health</b> claims soared by 13.7 per cent among the under 30 age group in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three in four of the claimants were women and they spent an average of a month in private mental facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychiatry and acute <b>mental health</b> care is now the top service used by privately insured heath fund members under the age of 59, up from second place in 2018-19, the study released by <span class="companylink">Private Healthcare <b>Australia</b> (PHA) </span>shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third of young people with high <b>mental health</b> claims (above $10,000) received hospital treatment for depressive disorders and one in five had anxiety disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in eight had an eating disorders and one in 10 had other mental and substance use disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHA chief executive Dr Rachel David said the high cost <b>mental health</b> claims proved that health cover was of value to younger people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s quite clear that the impact of long term lockdowns without any certainty about where they were going to end has hit younger people particularly hard,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’re talking about people that are very vulnerable stage of their development who were possibly locked down in circumstances with people who they didn’t necessarily like or get along with, or in the worst case, may even have been their abusers,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people were prevented from face-to-face interactions with their social network, lost the chance to celebrate milestones, couldn’t play sport or do performing arts and endless TikTok videos on weight loss probably fuelled eating disorders, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Liptember Foundation survey found an alarming one in five girls in their teenage years experienced eating disorders and suicide/self harm at rates more than double the normal population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three in four teenagers felt stressed, while six in 10 were facing anxiety and body image issues, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renae Flanigan was a carer for her parents who both suffer <b>mental health</b> issues when <b>Covid</b> lockdowns made her own anxiety problems worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 25 year old from Melbourne could not find work after completing a design course because of the <b>pandemic</b>, which brought her mental issues to the fore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did feel like I was at breaking point and I had to do something. That’s when I reached out for help,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A peer support group for young carers showed her she was not alone and she began seeing a therapist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is now training to be a <b>mental health</b> public relations worker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t feel that <b>pandemic</b> caused a lot of the <b>mental health</b> issues. I feel like a lot of it was already there and it just allowed people the time to actually sit and reflect,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, across all health conditions in 2021, the PHA study found health funds faced 382,400 high-cost hospital claims where the benefit exceeded $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest benefit paid last year was $714,134 for the treatment of a birth defect that caused a hole in the diaphragm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 5000 Australians with <b>Covid</b> also opted to use their private cover to pay for their hospital care since January 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One patient in their 80s spent 51 days in hospital at a cost of $159,198.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With working from home a norm many people are reluctant to take a sickie. Story by Jared Lynch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> enters halfway through its third year, bosses of <b>Australia</b>’s biggest companies are urging their staff to stay away from work at the slightest hint of sickness, even if they have the previously innocuous common cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gone are the days of when Aussies would “soldier on” – like in the old Codral advertisements – pop a cold and flu pill, stuff a hanky up their sleeve and hop on a packed train to their high-rise CBD office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they also aren’t hiding under the doona either. I interviewed <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> group executive people and culture, Kylie Bishop, for this story while she was isolating at home with <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>pandemic</b> has sparked a shift to remote or hybrid working, where being at the office full-time from 9am to 5pm is no longer necessary and neither is taking the humble “sickie” – even if you are unwell. Employees have managed to structure their work days around home life, rather than the other way around, erasing the need for “unplanned absences”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remote working has become the biggest office trend since hot-desking a decade ago – with thousands of Australian employees encouraged to again work from home during the latest wave of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> infections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">NIB</span> even pays its staff $1200 a year each in recognition of “renting space in people’s homes”, the government’s peak science agency, <span class="companylink">CSIRO</span>, arranges for the home delivery of ergonomic office equipment for its employees, while <b>Australia</b>’s biggest health insurer <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> has become workplace agnostic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unions have also weighed in, stepping up demands on employers to better protect workers by ensuring all employees who can work from home do so, going further than advice ­released by the country’s leading doctors. But could this new flexibility be making Australian employees sicker?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Katherine Paroz, a former human resources executive at <span class="companylink">Telstra</span> who now heads <span class="companylink">CSIRO</span>’s HR division, believes there could be longer-term pain – and a greater cost to staff and their bosses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Doctor’s appointments, picking up kids, looking after parents, sick kids or your friend who broke up with their boyfriend, meeting the bank/accountant, going to the dentist, running errands …. all stuff that was hard to do on the weekend could require a sickie,” Paroz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is before we even mention hangovers, late nights or ‘doona’ <b>mental health</b> days. All real needs in their own way but not covered by legitimate employer leave categories and ending up as ‘unplanned absences’ with HR codes like SLNMC (sick leave no medical certificate).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(But) are we in fact replacing the unplanned sickie – which as employers we endlessly complained about the cost of – with the risk of long-term impacts on the wellbeing of our people due to long hours of work, less than ideal ergonomics, social <b>isolation</b>, poorer relationships and connection to work communities, less than ideal training and development arrangements and conditions where we begin to believe meeting people on video calls is actually a substitute for real human interaction?” And here is how Australian workers became victims of their own success during the <b>pandemic</b>. Paroz says employees adjusted quickly when they were initially ordered to work from home when <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> hit in early 2020, up-ending previous “suspicions” about the practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Amazingly most things kept happening and productivity was okay. Most people actually began working harder and lines blurred further between work and life. “In fact now, even if people are sick it is more likely they keep working … get out of bed, down a few Codral, head to the laptop, camera off, and keep going. Save all of the sick leave for when you really hurt yourself or get really sick at some point in the future. Manage all your other life stuff in a long weekday, blending work with life from as early as 6am often until late in the evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And therein lies our next challenge.” When I speak to <span class="companylink">Medibank</span>’s Kylie Bishop, she begins the interview with a disclaimer. “I will let you know, I’ve got <b>Covid</b>, just so it doesn’t sound awkward on the phone from time-to-time I might just mute myself so you don’t have me coughing in your ear.” We press on. Bishop says that absenteeism levels at <span class="companylink">Medibank</span> are beginning to return to pre-<b>pandemic</b> levels. Although Bishop made an exception for a media interview, the health insurer encourages people to take a sick day if they’re unwell. “You can see that decline in the expectation that I still have to attend this meeting but I’m feeling a little bit not right and normally I would have taken a sick day,” Bishop says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s something that we have tried to keep a really live conversation in leadership teams. You’re in my meeting, I would say ‘Jared, I think you can just afford to be sick today, there’s no need for you to join this meeting’. It’s often the storytelling of that, that we try to be really strong on.” It’s a message that extends beyond companies where the majority of staff are “knowledge workers”. Even businesses where workers must be on location to prevent mass disruption – just look what happened across the supermarkets earlier this year when <b>pandemic isolation</b> rules sparked grocery shortages – are encouraging their workers to stay at home if they’re unwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for <b>Australia</b>’s biggest supermarket chain, <span class="companylink">Woolworths</span> says the message is clear, and that if people are sick they should take sick leave and rest. “Since the start of the <b>pandemic</b> and its various waves, we have consistently reinforced the need for team members to take care of themselves. This ranges from taking sick leave if they are unwell, so they can get rest and recover to also in support functions giving team members the flexibility to work from home,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recent rise in cases as well as the cold and flu season also reflects on the duty of care to our customers, team members and communities. We all have a role to play in staying COVIDSafe and maintaining our COVIDSafe measures, especially now as cases rise again.” This can be easier said than done when casual workers face the risk of not being paid, as inflation returns, if they take sick leave. To this end, Anthony Albanese backflipped on maintaining the $750 emergency payment for workers without sick leave, following pressure by state leaders, unions and some even in his own party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">NIB</span> group chief people officer Martin Adlington says the working from home experience “has been one of evolution”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve all worked through the <b>pandemic</b> period where we have all had to get used to these work practices and for us we decided to implement that hybrid work in an ongoing way,” Adlington says. “What we have seen though, is quite quickly we’ve fallen into good practices.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report into technology-facilitated abuse speaks to male perpetrators as Australian women are pushed into the shadows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Receiving dozens of calls, threatening text messages or having your tech tracked by an ex isn’t just OTT and irritating, it’s technology-facilitated abuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a new report released on Thursday by women's safety experts has revealed that 50% of Australian women will be victims of this form of abuse in our lifetimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for a lot of us, it will come from a former partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one of the features of this particular study, conducted by <b>Australia</b>'s National Research Organisation for Women's Safety, is that it doesn’t just draw from the experience of victims, but it delves into why perpetrators do it too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are they using technology in this invasive way?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person told the researchers: “It was just this sense of control of being able to know where they were, what they were doing, who they were with”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another said they felt they needed to “retain hold of that life”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the theme, the organisation found, is a clear one: control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the stats show that when abusers “lost” that control, well, things went downhill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Perpetrators primarily identified feeling angry and upset as their main motivators for engaging in technology-facilitated abuse in the context of intimate partner relationships,” the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They attributed this anger to a loss of control at the end of a relationship and losing daily contact with the victim and survivor.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another abuser told researchers that they wanted so badly to get in contact with their female victim they called her “about 150 times” in a two hour period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She didn’t pick up, but I just kept doing that,” the perpetrator told researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost one in three abusers said they thought the victim would “be ok with it. One in six thought their behaviour was “funny” and one in 10 thought their victim would be “flattered”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANROWS chief executive Padma Raman said the impacts of technology-facilitated abuse could include “physical, emotional and <b>mental health</b> harms as well as feelings of fear, paranoia and hyper-vigilance”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Victims and survivors explained that their experiences affected their ability to have personal and professional relationships with others, creating a sense of <b>isolation</b>,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research also showed police, internet platforms and other service providers like the telcos. had inconsistent approaches to addressing abuse at best, and could just be a bit hopeless at worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is vitally important that essential services have a proactive, policy-driven approach to preventing and responding to technology-facilitated abuse,” Raman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is also crucial, for the purposes of risk assessment, that technology-facilitated abuse by a current or former partner is understood as a potential risk indicator for multiple forms of domestic and family violence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who conducts a lot of research in this space and has powers to issue take down notices for things like the non-consensual sharing of images, said technology facilitated abuse made gender inequalities worse by discouraging women into pursuing positions of power where they could be more easily found and targeted online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Earlier research indicated that one in three professional Australian women have experienced some form of gendered online abuse and 25% of women won’t take job opportunities if they’re required to be in the media,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inman Grant told The Oz the average age of victims when they first experienced abuse was about 14, but children as young as eight had been targeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s been an 80% increase in youth based cyber bullying in the last six months of this year,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve seen and heard from the frontlines creative ways people misuse technology.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inman Grant said apps like UberEats were used by perpetrators to find out where their partner was, while others put threatening messages on banking transactions as a way to contact their victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in good news, banks including <span class="companylink">CBA</span>, recently installed Artificial Intelligence to identify and prevent such messages from being sent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inman Grant said she was concerned the number of women coming forward to report abuse to the eSafety Commission was only 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communications Minister Michelle Rowland urged people to take steps to protect themselves and urged those who have questions or concerns to get in touch with eSafety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"eSafety offers these resources in twelve different languages as well as tailored resources for people with intellectual or cognitive disabilities,\" Rowland said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canterbury’s desperation to keep Matt Burton prompted them to consider allowing Josh Addo-Carr to return to Melbourne for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bulldogs head of football Phil Gould was defiant on Monday night on the Nine Network when he spoke about Addo-Carr, insisting he was never going anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gould said he didn’t want to do the wrong thing by the club’s fans. Or the kids who wear Addo-Carr’s jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Gould insisted Addo-Carr was off limits, word on the street was that there were some at the Bulldogs who were willing to at least consider loaning Addo-Carr back to Melbourne because it would have cleared more than $100,000 under their salary cap, which they could have used to pay players in advance this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, in turn, would have given them access to more cap space next year. That money could have been thrown at Burton as they attempt to keep the NSW star at the club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burton is on less than $600,000 next season and the Bulldogs face a fight to keep him beyond that. It seems certain Burton will go on the market on November 1 unless the Bulldogs come up with an offer that is too good to refuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources close to Burton insist the starting price for the five-eighth begins with a nine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would make him one of the highest-paid players in the game but there is a belief in his inner circle that clubs would be willing to come to the party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NRL issues fireworks ban</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NRL has banned smoke-generating fireworks in a bid to prevent an embarrassing mishap after players struggled to see the ball after kick-offs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a growing trend of smoke covering the field when the ball is kicked off because of fireworks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue was brought to a head this week after Cronulla fullback Will Kennedy allowed the ball to bounce after the kick-off after losing sight of the ball because of the smoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smoke also delayed the start of Origin III this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sport Confidential has obtained a memo sent by NRL’s head of football Graham Annesley where he used the Kennedy example and warned the clubs against using fireworks just before kick-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On a number of occasions over recent weeks fireworks have been used as teams take the field resulting in a plume of smoke hanging over the field of play as the game commences,” Annesley wrote. “This obviously has the potential to affect the vision of players from both competing teams and could negatively impact play.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annesley then pointed to the operations manual which writes;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Under no circumstances are fireworks to be placed on the field of play at any time before the game without the prior approval of (Annesley). Also, for safety reasons no fireworks are to be placed anywhere near the Players tunnel as the Players enter the field”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annesley went on to say that “ in the last five minutes before kick-off at all future NRL games, no approval will be granted for any smoke generating fireworks”.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fox Sports has won the exclusive rights to broadcast the rugby league World Cup at the end of season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxtel and Kayo Sports will showcase 61 end of season matches – 31 men’s, 15 women’s and 15 wheelchair games from England between October 15 to November 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fox Sports executive director Steve Crawley said he was thrilled to secure the live and exclusive broadcast rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Fox League and Kayo Sports are flying this season and to now add the Rugby League World Cup is something to bang the drums about,” Crawley said. “All exclusive rights across the 61 matches of men’s, women’s and wheelchair footy very much celebrates the best of the best – on the true homes of rugby league.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radley’s X-rated punishment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He won’t wear the sky blues jersey again but Victor Radley’s short stint as a NSW squad member has earned the ire of the NRL after he was sanctioned for his lewd dressing room antics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radley has escaped with a suspended $5000 fine and a warning from NRL boss Andrew Abdo after an X-rated gesture was caught on camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was caught simulating a lewd act on teenage Blues and Sydney Roosters teammate Joseph Suaalii after the Blues’ Origin II victory in Perth. The NRL took into account mitigating circumstances primarily that Radley was caught unaware that he was on live television. However, the NRL still deemed he brought the game into disrepute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident prompted Abdo to meet personally with Radley who has courted trouble on occasions during his young career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abdo emerged from those talks and opted to sanction the Roosters lock, albeit with the fine suspended provided he doesn’t find himself in trouble again any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is expected to be Radley’s final act as a NSW player after he surprised many by opting to represent England at the end of year world cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision – which was announced earlier this month - means Radley will be unable to play for NSW again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident involving Radley prompted the players union to hit out at footage from the sanctity of the dressing room being made available to broadcast networks and said they would discuss the use of cameras during the next round of <span class="companylink">CBA</span> negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radley was banned for two matches and fined $20,000 - half of which was suspended - after tackling a party gatecrasher in Byron Bay during the summer. The suspended fine had lapsed before the most recent indiscretion but he will need to keep his nose clean for the next 12 months after earning the ire of the NRL again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abdo has shown a willingness to meet players since taking over as chief executive - he warned Brisbane star Kotoni Staggs over his behaviour last year and recently took Matt Lodge through the machinations of the salary cap when he was in talks with the Sydney Roosters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaufusi’s Tongan family matter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felise Kaufusi hasn’t had the chance yet to tell his father Taniela that he will play for Tonga at the World Cup. When he does, he is pretty sure it will bring a smile to his father’s face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, when Kaufusi played for <b>Australia</b> against Tonga, his dad rocked up in Tongan colours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That memory no doubt played a part in Kaufusi’s decision to declare his allegiance to Tonga for this year’s World Cup, much to the disappointment of Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importance of family has been rammed home to Kaufusi in recent weeks after he was forced to rush to America to be by Taniela’s side following a medical emergency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taniela is now back in <b>Australia</b> but he is on a ventilator as he works his way back to health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mum and the family are pretty stoked,” Kaufusi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Dad will be pumped. He wore Tonga gear to the game when we played them in 2018. It’s something I have been sitting on for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had a conversation with Kristian Woolf. He said it was up to me. He said he didn’t want me to wait to see whether I made the Kangaroos team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am not that type of person and I don’t think I would want to play with someone who wanted to wait around to see whether they got picked in another team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is the opportunity to represent my heritage, my family, and challenge the best sides. I think that would be the pinnacle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woolf inadvertently let slip to Meninga at a World Cup function that he was chasing Kaufusi. Kaufusi, however, only informed Meninga of his decision recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was at a promo for the World Cup and he was on stage with Kristian,” Kaufusi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Woolf let it slip. I think that took Mal by surprise. He said he was going to give me a call. I said I don’t want to stuff you around, I am playing for Tonga at the World Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was really good about. He understood my reasoning. He wished me good luck.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His decision also ensures he won’t face the Tongan side again. When he played for the Kangaroos four years ago, the Tongan players saved a bit extra for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was daunting against Tonga when they were doing the haka and then they played the national anthem,” Kaufusi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They saved a bit of extra sauce playing against me.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eels sign Nathan Brown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Warriors coach Nathan Brown has taken his first steps into life after head coaching with the Eels signing Brown on a short-term deal to review its elite pathways program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eels have dedicated themselves to invigorating their junior development structures and view Brown as an important cog to helping them enhance their pathways system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role will see Brown review Parramatta’s development system and explore potential improvements to aid the Eels’ brightest young prospects in readying themselves for the top grade according to Parramatta’s head of football Mark O’Neill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nathan has a wealth of experience both as an NRL player and Head Coach at every level within the game,” O’Neill said. “Importantly, Nathan has been exposed to many pathways programs and is highly passionate about this space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Through his involvement, Nathan will be able to give us an informed view of where our programs are at and what opportunities there will be to make improvements in line with best practice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other clubs have reached out to the ex-Dragons and Knights coach who despite not wanting to be a head coach wants to remain involved in the game. He openly said his ambition was to now prevent a coach from being sacked as Brown transitions from an on-field role into a largely off-field position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ponga’s nervous head knock wait</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andre Ponga has allayed fears about his son Kalyn’s long-term future as the Newcastle superstar prepares to meet a neurosurgeon on Friday to determine whether he plays again this season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ponga suffered his fifth head knock this year – and third in recent weeks – when he was ruled out of last Friday’s game against the Sydney Roosters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ponga wants to play for the Knights again this year but the final decision is likely to rest in the hands of the specialists and Newcastle officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Personally, we have spent a lot of time together – I took his money on the golf course (this week),” Andre said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He is in a good space. We just have to wait for the meeting and go from there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether he was concerned for his son, Andrew replied: “To be honest, no. He is in a good space. I honestly wouldn’t be worried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He would play tomorrow if he could. We just have to wait to see what the professionals say and go from there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you were to say where you think he is at, I would say he is mentally okay. If anything, he is just not doing his calculations on the golf course any good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would be worried if he was having bad symptoms.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ponga’s immediate future will be one of the main issues for the Knights incoming head of football, Peter Parr. Parr will begin his new job with Newcastle on Monday and Ponga aside, the most contentious issues are the future of coach Adam O’Brien</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it is always dangerous when decisions around football clubs are left in the hands of one person,” Parr said. “Phillip is still the CEO and there is a board. My view on the coach from a personal view is that he will be getting my absolute, 100 per cent support, and I will be trying to work with him to get things back to where everyone in the club and region wants them to get back to. My understanding is that he is a terrific bloke and that was backed up in the brief conversation I had with him. I do know previous to this year he got the club to the finals two years in a row and that would suggest to me that he can coach as well. I am really looking forward to working with him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eddie Jones’s Rabbitohs rebuff</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Eddie Jones wants to coach South Sydney, he may be waiting a while. Jones, the former Wallabies coach who is now in charge of England, has made no secret of his desire to one day coach in the NRL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went public again this week with his quest to take the reins of the Rabbitohs, the club he has followed since he was a boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only problem for Jones is that Souths have a coach who is doing a handy job. The Rabbitohs are in no rush to replace Jason Demetriou, although they appreciate Jones’ high-profile support</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s great to hear that Eddie is a long term supporter of South Sydney but Jason is doing a fine job as head coach of the Rabbitohs and we have great confidence in the coaching team and our football management,” Souths chief executive Blake Solly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is no place on the Rabbitohs coaching staff for Jones, Sam Burgess is returning to Redfern after knocking back the chance to join the Dolphins.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Gal made the bet that if Queensland win origin that it has to happen up here,” Hodges said. “He’s from the old school, he’s man of his word. I’m just waiting to hear that he’s going to hold up his end of the bet and take me on up here in enemy territory for him. After all, he’s the one that asked for it in the first place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I certainly don’t think he’s scared to fight me, but I reckon his confidence took a hit when the Maroons took out Origin. I know I’m a massive underdog in this one but so was Queensland and look how that turned out.“</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melbourne’s desperate bid to secure an outside back looks to have finally ended with the Storm set to sign Wests Tigers flyer David Nofoaluma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Storm have been scrambling to add an outside back to their depleted backline after a stack of recent injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nofoaluma looks likely to answer their SOS call after telling teammates of his plans on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 28-year-old would play out the year at the Storm before returning to the Tigers next season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has had a turbulent 2022 season. Nofoaluma has battled concussion and spent a stint in reserve grade after being dropped for drinking while recovering from injury. He has been out of the top squad in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Storm have been desperately looking to sign an outside back before the August 1 trade window closes. They have been linked to Nofoaluma’s Tigers teammates including Daine Laurie, Adam Doueihi and Ken Maumalo and Penrith’s Robert Jennings. The Storm also sounded out ex-Melbourne flyer Josh Addo-Carr and departing Warrior Reece Walsh but were knocked back by the respective clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his best, Nofoaluma is among the top finishers in the game having scored a club record 95 tries from 175 matches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is expected to link with the Storm this week and be right to play in their round 21 clash against the Titans next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nofoaluma is contracted to the Tigers until the end of 2025 on a deal worth about $500,000 which makes him among the highest paid players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letting him go for the back end of the season not only saves the Tigers about $100,000 it will also potentially expose Nofoaluma to finals football for the first time in his decade long career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has played 12 matches this season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Storm injury toll is mounting. The likes of Ryan Papenhuyzen, Reimis Smith and George Jennings are sidelined for the rest of the year while Xaiver Coates will miss at least the next two more weeks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in two people will be victims of technology-facilitated abuse in their lifetimes, new data shows, with the eSafety Commission warning the average age Australians first experience online abuse is getting younger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>‘s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety also revealed in its report released today that one in four Australians would perpetrate abuse in their lifetimes and that gaining or maintaining control over the victim was the primary motivation of perpetrators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report heard from both victims and perpetrators, with one confirming the “sense of control” and needing to know where the victim was and what they were doing was the motivation behind the abuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I needed to retain hold of that life, and that control of that person I guess, and I felt like if I could just track all that stuff, I could do that somehow,” another perpetrator said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately one in three victims reported that their most recent experience of victimisation occurred in a current or former intimate partner relationship, with methods of abuse varying from threatening messages to installing software on a victim’s phone or computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANROWS chief executive Padma Raman said the range of harms experienced by victims and survivors of technology-facilitated abuse was long lasting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The impacts of technology-facilitated abuse can include physical, emotional and <b>mental health</b> harms, as well as feelings of fear, paranoia and hypervigilance,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Victims and survivors explained that their experiences affected their ability to have personal and professional relationships with others, creating a sense of <b>isolation</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research revealed police, internet platforms and other service providers such as telecommunication companies had inconsistent approaches to addressing abuse and could be highly ineffective in meeting the needs of victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is vitally important that essential services have a proactive, policy-driven approach to preventing and responding to technology-facilitated abuse. It is also crucial, for the purposes of risk assessment, that technology-facilitated abuse by a current or former partner is understood as a potential risk indicator for multiple forms of domestic and family violence,” Ms Raman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman was represented on the ANROWS Project Advisory Group and said technology facilitated abuse exasperated gender inequalities by discouraging women into positions of power where they can be more easily found and targeted online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Earlier research indicated that one in three professional <b>Australia</b> women have experienced some form of gendered online abuse and 25 per cent of women won’t take job opportunities if they’re required to be in the media,” she told The Australian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Inman Grant confirmed the average age of victims when they first experienced abuse was about 14, but children as young as eight had presented as victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s been an 80 per cent increase in youth based cyber bullying in the last six month of this year,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve seen and heard from the front lines creative ways people misuse technology.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Inman Grant said apps like <span class="companylink">Uber</span> eats were used by perpetrators to find out where their partner was, while others put threatening messages on banking transactions as a way to contact the victim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, banks including the <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank of <b>Australia</b></span> had recently installed Artificial Intelligence to identify and prevent such messages from being sent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Inman Grant said she was concerned the number of women coming forward to report abuse to the eSafety Commission was only 2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Help seeking was low generally victim survivors,” she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TELEVISION ROYAL RECOGNITION FOR HILLS’ NOT-SO-SECRET SERVICES TO HILARITY Adam Hills was slightly shaken – and definitely stirred – last year when he received an envelope marked “On Her Majesty’s Service”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My first thought was, ‘Ooh, am I the new James Bond?’” says the Aussie comedian with a laugh, over the phone from his London base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any disappointment he might have felt at discovering he wasn’t in fact going to replace the outgoing Daniel Craig as secret agent 007 was replaced with a feeling of immense pride that he was joining Australian entertainers such as Clive James, Barry Humphries and Kylie Minogue as a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s kind of huge,” he says. “Especially in comedy where you don’t get a degree, you don’t get a professional telling you that you’ve achieved a certain thing, even comedy awards are few and far between. So, to be given something like this, it’s just like a permanent marker to say, ‘Yes, you’ve made it to a certain point’.” Even more gratifying for the stand-up comedy veteran and long-running host of the much-loved ABC music quiz show Spicks and Specks was that the award was given for services to the Paralympics and disability awareness. Hills was born without a right foot and wears a prosthesis and now says the position and power that come with hosting his top-rating UK comedy-news show, The Last Leg, come with a responsibility to talk about “something that I didn’t necessarily embrace when I was younger – my disability”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m really proud of what we’ve done on The Last Leg for the Paralympics and with the disability rugby league,” says Hills, who will also suit up for either <b>Australia</b> or England in the Physical Disability Rugby League World Cup later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He still hasn’t received his actual medal yet – but the honour also comes with another unexpected benefit. “Apparently, if you have an MBE, then either you or your children can get married in St Paul’s Cathedral,” he says. “I’ve spoken to my daughter she is up for it. All I have to do is convince Tom Holland to propose to her and then this thing is all going to come together.” Since moving back to <b>Australia</b> from the UK in 2019 with his wife, Melbourne performer Ali McGregor, and their two daughters Maisie, 8, and Beatrice, 12, Hills has been splitting his time between the two countries. Although the added inconvenience of hotel <b>quarantine</b> is now over, he admits it’s a struggle to be away from them for extended periods of time but he’s determined to make the most of his comedy opportunities while he’s at “the top of my game”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pain of missing milestones in their lives is somewhat balanced by the joy of opportunities like taking the family to the recent Glastonbury festival, but Hills says the separation is “definitely taking its toll”. “It’s a bit of a struggle at the moment,” he admits. “I’m afraid, there’s not a funny answer at the end of that one.” Having been happily dragged around Glastonbury last month to see some of his daughters’ favourite acts such as Olivia Rodrigo, Girl In Red and Mitski, Hills says he’s grateful for their musical input into life, particularly with the return of Spicks and Spicks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Logie-winning quiz show was rebooted in 2019 after eight years off air but, every time it returns, host Hills and his team captains Alan Brough and Myf Warhurst work hard to make sure they are bringing something fresh to viewers rather than slipping back into a pair of comfy slippers and trading on nostalgia. Spicks and Specks now has guests who grew up watching the show and turn up excited to be on the set and familiar with what’s expected of them, which Hills says energises the veterans and regulars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s very important to me when we’re making Spicks and Spicks that we don’t just rehash what we used to do,” Hills says. “With a decade’s worth of new music to cover, and especially with a 12-year-old daughter who’s across most of that new music, it was kind of important for me that we don’t just ask questions about the ’70s and the ’80s and the ’90s. I wanted to make sure we’re including people like Olivia Rodrigo or Amy Shark, or Tones and I or people that have been big over the last few years so, yeah, it’s like it’s like an upgraded pair of slippers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With this series, we came up with a new game called Secret Song where, as well as asking questions, I spent each episode dropping hints and clues about a secret song and then, if teams could name the secret song at the end of the show, they got an extra five points.” Hills also views the show – which teams up a musician and a comedian with each captain – as a chance to give performers who have been starved of the chance to ply their trade in recent years due to the <b>pandemic</b> an all-too-rare shot at TV exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The series we made during <b>lockdown</b> was a chance to just get people out of the house,” he says. “It almost felt like we were there for the <b>mental health</b> of some of the performers. But then this time, it was like, ‘Well, we’re now helping them get back on their feet’.” Hills says he’s slowly getting back into stand-up comedy but says that many performers are still getting their mojo back after years away from live performing. And some audiences, he says, have forgotten how to be audiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were a couple of charity comedy gigs that I did last year – two in particular where, in each, a member of the audience had to be removed because they were too drunk. What was weird about that is normally charity gigs are the loveliest … I think it was just peoplebeing out and about, not necessarily comedy fans, they haven’t seen a lot of shows, they finally get back out and have one too many drinks and they forget how to behave.” Spicks and Specks, starts August 7, 7.40pm, ABC</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIF looks set to become the first Australian health insurer to cover psychedelic substances such as ecstasy and psilocybin – more commonly known as magic mushrooms – as evidence grows that the drugs can help people with <b>mental health</b> issues including PTSD, substance abuse, and anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIF chief Justin James says psychedelics’ medicinal potential is “extraordinary” and imagines a future for the health insurance firm to play a role in delivering them to Australians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the first sign that health insurance firms are taking note of growing medical interest in the healing potential of drugs that were, until recently, most commonly understood as illicit hallucinogens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have a keen interest in what is coming and what we, in being a health fund, can provide members into the future – particularly around better choice and access,” Mr James said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Post-<b>Covid</b>, we’re seeing one in five claims … for <b>mental health</b> episodes, and that’s appearing in much younger areas of society than it ever has before. That means our members are going to suffer more … if we don’t have alternatives, if we don’t start seeing some progressive ways to deal with these issues.” HIF is a Perth-based not-for-profit health fund that reported 104,163 members by the middle of 2021 and boasts the largest customer base in Western <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">CSIRO</span> recently announced it would be working with biomedical companies to test and develop psychedelic medicines and patient experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr James said he wants HIF to be at the “forefront” of helping its members access medicines if and when psychedelics make it through regulatory and clinical hurdles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We also want to play a significant role partnering with providers and manufacturers to reduce the cost that we might not be able to cover in a full rebate as well,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIF has a track record of being an early adopter of newer medical treatments; it was the first Australian health insurance provider to provide coverage for medicinal cannabis in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think for a small to medium company like ourselves, our members want to see us differentiate by being able to tap into what’s new and what’s coming,” Mr James said. “That is a differentiator and I think that’s something that we pride ourselves on being able to do.” Mr James expressed optimism in the tone of national conversation about the potential of psychedelics. “I think there’s a genuine inquiry and intrigue,” he said. “Hopefully that leads to quicker change. “The sooner the better if it’s going to work.” Researchers say psychedelics are particularly promising for patients who do not respond to traditional psychotherapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost half of all Australians are estimated to suffer from a <b>mental health</b> disorder at some point in their lifetime, of whom more than a third do not respond to existing treatments. The federal Health Department last year provided $15m in grants to promote research in the burgeoning field. The <span class="companylink">US Food and Drug Administration</span> labelled psilocybin and MDMA as “breakthrough therapies” – describing promising treatments that could fulfil an unmet need.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools should be the last institutions to close during a <b>pandemic</b> and the first to reopen, a group of prominent Australians says as it calls for a youth body to advise the Albanese government and ensure children’s interests are not placed behind adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what the <span class="companylink">University of Sydney</span> says is the first independent report into <b>Australia</b>’s performance as a society over the first 2.5 years of the <b>pandemic</b>, a taskforce of business, academic and community leaders says government responses to crises “were at times inconsistent, messy and counter-productive” and a new round of national reform is needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report comes as federal and state leaders continue to resist mask mandates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Albanese on Sunday he still did not have advice that a mask mandate was necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have stuck to the advice that I have received from Professor (Paul) Kelly and I will continue to do so,” he told Sky News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday said he was only “asking” people to consider masks, and will not make them complusory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The most important thing people can do is use that common sense. I’m not telling people what to do, I’m just asking,” he said in Melbourne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university’s Open Society, Common Purpose taskforce finds children have not received the attention they should have during <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> and were excluded from public policy decisions despite being some of those most affected by government interventions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of its 12 recommendations to the Albanese government, the first four prioritise children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include establishment of a youth fund – similar to the ­Future Fund, which makes investments for the benefit of future generations – to invest strategically in children “to create genuine equal opportunity and improved wellbeing”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The taskforce also says an independent national youth body should be created to advise national leaders and prevent the interests of children “being placed second to those of adults”, and <b>pandemic</b>-­related school closures need to be reviewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Albanese government’s attention is turning to the return of Parliament where the issues of climate change, <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and the economy will be in focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This review should examine the full epidemiological evidence relating to school closures to determine when they are effective and necessary,” the report, to be launched on Monday by Assistant Competition, Charities and Treasury Minister Andrew Leigh and titled The Great Australian Renovation, says. “The review should examine the educational and wider wellbeing effects of school closures on children and young people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taskforce co-chair Mark Rigotti labelled children the “forgotten heroes of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>” who had sacrificed enormously to keep their parents and grandparents from harm, and said it was time for <b>Australia</b> to help them get back on track for their future. “Their lack of a public voice meant their needs were often placed second to those of adults, robbing them of important life experiences and development opportunities, with potentially long-term costs to their welfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This must not be allowed to happen again,” Mr Rigotti said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The budget in October is an important opportunity to repay the sacrifices of our young people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fellow co-chair Tim Soutphommasane noted the Albanese government’s election pledge to “establish a framework to directly and formally engage with young Australians on an ongoing basis” and urged Labor to make it a national priority. “The <b>pandemic</b> has shown us that we must give young people a louder public voice,” he said. “We need to invest in young people as a first priority so that we can equalise the impacts of the <b>pandemic</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youth Minister Anne Aly said work was already under way to set up a new office for youth and she was developing a “youth engagement model” with stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other task force recommendations include a minister for integrity and accountability, a national office for multicultural affairs, an annual state of the nation address, a prime minister’s question time with questions from the public, a national debate commission and limits on political advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The task force also comprises Institute of Infectious Diseases co-director Ben Marais, Committee for Sydney chief executive Gabriel Metcalf, Settlement Services International chief executive Violet Roumeliotis, United Workers Union president Jo Schofield, University College London Policy Lab director Marc Stears, Matilda Centre for <b>Mental Health</b> director Maree Teesson and Just Reinvest NSW chief executive Geoffrey Winters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After overcoming a six-year battle with disordered eating, Olivia Molly Rogers made a promise to never change herself for anyone again. Now, six years into her recovery, she’s never gone back on her word. An in-demand model and presenter, Rogers no longer fears showing the world her true self – or advocating for causes she believes in When Olivia Molly Rogers chats with Stellar two days before flying to Sydney for this shoot, she’s buzzing with anticipation. “I’m very excited. I’m really looking forward to it,” the 30-year-old admits over the phone. Yet if you had asked the Melbourne-based media personality how she felt before a photoshoot 10 years ago, you would have received a very different response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, Rogers was in the grips of an eating disorder that was only exacerbated by her efforts to break into the modelling industry. Often forced to drastically decrease her measurements in order to please clients, Rogers became addicted to losing weight, and it wasn’t until she was 24 (six years into the cycle of dieting and purging) that she recognised the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Rogers is in a much happier place. “One of the big differences for me now is that if I book a shoot, I’m booking it as Olivia. I’m booking it as myself,” she explains. “I’m not going to have someone telling me that I’m too big for the clothes – they’re going to get clothes that fit me. Whereas when I was modelling, I was more of a mannequin. I always felt a lot of pressure and like I was never quite good enough. It’s a different experience now.” A former speech pathologist, Rogers became a household name when she took out the Miss Universe <b>Australia</b> title in 2017 – just six months into her recovery. “I was completely apprehensive when they first reached out,” Rogers admits. “I was in the early days of my recovery and the thought of being put up and compared to other girls just made me feel anxious. I know that girls in the past, with different owners of the competition, have been told to get certain surgeries. And I was like, there’s absolutely no way I’m going to change myself.” While it might seem counterintuitive to enter a competition that has previously rewarded a one-dimensional representation of beauty after battling an eating disorder, Rogers notes that under the ownership of Troy and Sophia Barbagallo, the pageant is more concerned with celebrating diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To them, it’s really important that the winner of Miss Universe does have a voice and has a message and isn’t afraid to share that,” explains Rogers. “That’s not to say [winners] in the past weren’t like that, but there’s definitely a strong focus now on what the winner has to say, not just how beautiful they are. I think Maria Thattil [Miss Universe <b>Australia</b> 2020] is a perfect example of that. She’s unapologetically herself. And I think that shines through.” Like Thattil, Rogers isn’t afraid to speak out when it counts. In 2021, she chronicled her <b>mental health</b> and body image struggles in her debut book Find Your Light, and appeared on the cover of Body+Soul to share her story. Although Rogers was nervous to bare such intimate details to the public, it’s a decision she doesn’t regret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sharing that kind of really raw story is always a bit scary, but the feedback from that, and also from the book in general, has been nothing but positive,” she tells Stellar. “The whole purpose of me putting the book out there was to hopefully help other people – and that’s been the feedback that I’ve been getting.” As a supporter of DonateLife Week, which begins today, Rogers is also a vocal advocate for organ donation – and it’s a cause close to her heart. “I have been supporting DonateLife for a few years now since my uncle, Oren Klemich, joined the advisory board,” Rogers explains. “In 2009, Oren’s son, my cousin Jack, died tragically and suddenly as a result of meningococcal disease. Jack and I were very close; he was such a beautiful, funny, charismatic person and we all absolutely adored him. He was only 18, but he was a registered organ donor so he was able to change the lives of four Australians when he died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I admire Oren and Gill [Jack’s mum], and Jack’s sisters Georgie and Sophie so much,” she continues. “They have done an amazing job at advocating for both organ donation and the meningococcal vaccine. I’m very lucky to call them family.” After witnessing the life-changing impact of Jack’s donation, Rogers informed her family if anything were to happen to her, she consented to being an organ donor. “What’s the point of these perfectly good organs being buried with you when you could save a life?” she tells Stellar. “It’s a grim topic so I think a lot of people avoid it, but it’s important. I don’t think a lot of people realise that it’s not something you opt out of – you have to opt in. You just need your Medicare card and you can jump online and register in a minute. And then make sure everybody knows what your wishes are because, ultimately, your family makes that final decision.” Although four in five Australians support organ donation, there are still 13 million eligible people who have yet to register. “We really need to get those organ-donor numbers up,” notes Rogers. “This week, we hope that talking about Jack and sharing his story will hopefully help people to see the impact that it has.” For Rogers, Jack’s untimely death was a stark reminder of how fragile and fleeting life can be, but she takes comfort in the legacy he left behind. “It taught me to be a bit of a ‘yes’ girl, to live life to the fullest, because you just don’t know,” reflects Rogers. “Every big milestone that I’ve had since he passed away, I just appreciate and acknowledge how lucky I am to have those opportunities – because he never got to.” One such milestone occurred in February, when Rogers finally wed her long-term partner Justin McKeone after postponing twice due to <b>Covid</b> lockdowns. “It was the best day,” beams Rogers. “Everyone always asks if married life is different, but I don’t think it is. You just wear an extra ring and you have really great memories and that’s what we have.” Although <b>Covid</b> thwarted many of Rogers’ work and travel plans, the recent easing of restrictions has allowed her to get reacquainted with her suitcase – and her family. “It’s been amazing to be able to go interstate [to] work and see my family, as they’re all in South <b>Australia</b>,” she explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the work gigs that have been keeping her busy? Rogers is playing it coy. “I hate being that person, but there are some secret projects coming up,” she says with a laugh. In the meantime, Rogers’ work with DonateLife, her ambassadorship with the Australian Childhood Foundation and her collaboration with Bianko, an Australian sustainable jewellery label, are enough to keep her occupied. And then there’s her side hustle, Olivia Molly Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My mum says that as soon as I could hold a pencil I was drawing, and back when I studied to be a speech pathologist I sold my art on the side to get through uni,” she reveals. “The possibilities are endless when it comes to creativity. I like being busy and I like having variety in my life. I’m definitely not short on that at the moment.” For more information on organ donation and to register as a donor, visit donatelife.gov.au.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Touring party inclusio n good news for Pucovski WILL Pucovski remains squarely on the radar of national selectors with the one-Test batter bound for India next month as part of an Australian development touring party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move that suggests Pucovski could be in the frame for the Test tour of India early next year, it’s understood he is set to be included in the squad to head to the subcontinent in August as part of a longstanding reciprocal deal between <span class="companylink">Cricket <b>Australia</b></span> and the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scheme, whereby Indian pace bowlers come to <b>Australia</b> to hone their skills while Australian players — mainly batters and spinners — head to India to work on their games on turning wickets, was parked in recent years because of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, but it is set to resume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <b>Australia</b> continues to plan for life after Nathan Lyon, emerging spinners such as Tanveer Sangha, Todd Murphy and Matt Kuhnemann are set to make the trip as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry Hunt, who has worked his way into the Test frame as an opener after strong form for South <b>Australia</b> and <b>Australia</b> A, is also poised to be part of the squad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the most significant inclusion is set to be that of Pucovski, whose stop-start career has been hindered by a litany of head knocks, the most recent coming in the pre-play warm-up during a Sheffield Shield match for Victoria at Adelaide Oval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classy right-hander returned the following month, making a half-century in the Shield final against Western <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was bypassed for the <b>Australia</b> A tour of Sri Lanka, but has been training strongly with the Vics through the Melbourne winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pucovski played his sole Test to date against India in January 2021, making 62 and 10 before being sidelined for months with a shoulder injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also grappled at times with <b>mental-health</b> issues and has never toured with a senior Australian side, albeit he was part of the extended group from which the 2019 Ashes squad was selected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been uncertainty over the precise nature of some of Pucovski’s head knocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident in Adelaide was at the time thought to be his 11th concussion, but a subsequent CA and Cricket Victoria medical investigation revealed that “some of the previous injuries sustained had involved low trauma force and therefore were most likely not true concussion but a form of either post-traumatic migraine or stress-related response’’. Despite all his setbacks, Pucovski remains a player of immense talent and a potential long-term saviour at the top of the order for <b>Australia</b> given incumbent openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja are both 35 and Marcus Harris has been unable to secure his spot despite repeated opportunities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooper feeling ‘low’ after being sent home from camp Australian swimmer Isaac Cooper has broken his silence on his expulsion from the Commonwealth Games team, saying the medication he misused was not a “banned substance” and that his “behaviour and <b>mental health</b>” led to his expulsion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooper was sent home this week for what <span class="companylink">Swimming <b>Australia</b></span> called “wellbeing challenges, including the use of medication”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a lengthy post on <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>, the Tokyo Olympian, who was a good chance of a medal in the 50m and 100m backstroke in Birmingham, said the last few days had “been tough”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve had to undergo a lot of self-reflection and examination,” Cooper wrote. “The decision made to send me home was based on my behaviour and <b>mental health</b> and was made in my best interest and that of the team competing at the Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My misuse of medication was not banned substances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was ultimately my wellbeing and <b>mental health</b> that resulted in me going home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was difficult to accept in myself that I needed to address my <b>mental health</b>, but I believe that it is an ever present issue in all communities, including that of a professional athlete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am grateful to <span class="companylink">Swimming <b>Australia</b></span> for helping to identify an issue and offering their support and resources to help me.” Mystery still surrounds the specifics of the prescription drug that Cooper used while on team camp and what else occurred that resulted in the swimmer being warned several times and then ultimately cut from the Commonwealth Games team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooper said in his <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> post that there were “two sides” of the story. “There are always two sides to a story and I shall continue to work positively and confidentially with <span class="companylink">Swimming <b>Australia</b></span>,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooper said he wished he could be in Birmingham to race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was due to debut in four events – the 50m and 100m backstroke, 50m butterfly and 50m freestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Tokyo Olympics last year he finished 12th in the 100m backstroke, and won a bronze medal as part of the mixed 4x100m medley relay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“More than anything I wish I could be there, racing with my team and cheering them on,” Cooper wrote. “The team means so much to me and I have made friends for life, but the decision was not made in the interest of the next few weeks, rather the interest for the future of my swimming career.” Cooper also said he would exit his swim club in Brisbane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have also come to the point in my career where I will have to move away from Rackley Swim Club,” Cooper wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They have done wonderful things to support me and have brought me to the level that I am at today. I will forever be grateful to my coaches and the support staff, but more than anything my squad mates. You are my family away from home and it breaks my heart that I won’t be seeing you every day any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the next few weeks I will be reflecting and resetting for the future. I will use this time of reflection to examine the current issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are always two sides to a story and I shall continue to work positively and confidentially with <span class="companylink">Swimming <b>Australia</b></span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would like to thank the many people who have reached out to me and my family and offered their help and assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It means more to me then you will ever know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My dad has always told me that Coopers are either up or getting up, but never down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m certainly pretty low, but this is the first step back up. I’ll see you there.” Meanwhile, at the swim team’s pre-Games camp in Chartres, France, medal hope Ariarne Titmus is enjoying the warm weather training and feeling confident about Birmingham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titmus’ rivalry with American Katie Ledecky was one of the storylines of last year’s Tokyo Olympics. But with Ledecky out of the picture this time, Titmus has a green light to dominate in the pool in Birmingham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been really nice to be here in the sun, feels like I’m back in the summer again,” Titmus said on Friday. “It was hard back home in the cold swimming, “I felt like I had such a great lead-up to trials and I felt everything fell into place and I think I swam one of the best 400s I have swum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things have changed since then. Obviously <b>Covid</b> post-trials put a bit of a spanner in the works but I think everyone has gone through that, so I’m just trying to get myself back to myself and I’m really excited to race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think I’ve got some really good work in, I have made some shifts and I’m feeling really good for Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think I have improved in some areas since trials. I’m looking forward to seeing how fast I can go at the Games.” Titmus already has three Commonwealth golds to her name, along with her two Olympic gold medals, silver and bronze.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young Australians are bearing the brunt of the nation’s <b>mental health</b> crisis, with almost half of all women aged 16-24 reporting a disorder in 2020-21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just under 40 per cent of the nation’s 16-24-year-olds, 1.1 million people, had a <b>mental health</b> condition in 2020-21, far higher than the overall proportion of 21.4 per cent for all adults, a landmark new report by the <span class="companylink">Australian Bureau of Statistics</span> reveals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for younger women the picture is especially grim, the latest ABS National Study of <b>Mental Health</b> and Wellbeing reveals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 46 per cent of females aged 16-24 reported some form of mental condition in 2020-21, compared to 31 per cent for males.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than four in 10 of these women had an anxiety condition such as social phobia or panic disorder in 2020-21, around twice the rate of males. And, while one in seven 16-24-year-olds overall had an affective disorder such as depression or bipolar, this rose to almost 20 per cent for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2021 study, based on survey responses of more than 5500 households nationally, reports a significant jump in the prevalence of <b>mental health</b> conditions from the previous study in 2007, in which 26 per cent of 16-24-year-olds had a <b>mental health</b> condition within a 12-month period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another disturbing marker for young women, reported on for the first time in the new study, was self-harming. One in four females aged 16-34 had self-harmed in their lifetime and 7 per cent had done so in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say the isolating impact of the <b>pandemic</b>, the dark side of social media and concerns about the state of the planet likely sit behind the disturbing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Blue chief executive Georgie Harman said the fact the survey was conducted in the midst of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> was only part of the reason for a decline in younger Australians’ <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve seen increasing distress among young people right around the world for many years and there could be many things involved here, from the <b>pandemic</b> to broader issues including job uncertainty, climate anxiety and rising social media use, which by its nature encourages social comparison,” Ms Harman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>’s deputy chief medical officer for <b>mental health</b>, Ruth Vine, said worsening <b>mental health</b> among young people was “causing concern in many countries”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There has been increasing levels of distress and anxiety in this cohort that predated <b>Covid</b>, but it has likely been exacerbated by <b>Covid</b>, with issues such as disrupted schooling,” Dr Vine said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Social media is another consideration. It can be good in terms of connection but can also be a harm if it’s leading to harassing behaviours. And young people are worried about global concerns as well,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study paints an overall picture of national <b>mental health</b> broadly similar to 2007. Fifteen years ago, 20 per cent of Australians reported having a <b>mental health</b> condition in the previous 12 months, rising to 21.5 per cent, or 4.2 million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 3.3 million people said they had an anxiety disorder in the previous 12 months. And 650,800 people (3.3 per cent of 16-85-year-olds) had a substance use disorder in 2020-21, whether it be alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 8.6 million 16-85-year-old Australians, four in 10, have experienced a <b>mental health</b> condition in their lifetime, the study finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 25 per cent of adult females had a <b>mental health</b> condition in 2020-21 compared to 18 per cent of men, they were also more likely to seek professional help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In 2020-21, 3.4 million Australians aged 16-85 years (17.5 per cent) saw a health professional for their <b>mental health</b>,” the report said. “More than one in five (22.8 per cent) females saw a health professional for their <b>mental health</b>, compared with one in eight males (12.2 per cent).” The study also looked at the issue of suicide, finding nearly 17 per cent of 16-85 year-old Australians had experienced serious suicidal thoughts or behaviours in their lifetime, and 5 per cent had attempted to take their own life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ABS report noted that mental ill-health does not define an individual’s life. “We acknowledge that people are living productive, purposeful and meaningful lives with mental ill-health,” it said.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor’s promise of a better future must start by helping those to whom it belongs In the giddy, round-midnight ­moments after claiming victory on May 21, Anthony Albanese steadied himself before the tipsy mosh at his feet and promised to run a government guided by two principles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No one left behind because we should always look after the disadvantaged and the vulnerable,” the prime minister-elect said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But also no one held back, ­because we should always support aspiration and opportunity.” Albanese addressed parents in public housing, just like his own single mum Maryanne, hoping each of them would “be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in <b>Australia</b> the doors of opportunity are open to us all”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving the life chances of our young people is the ultimate test for Labor’s opportunity agenda. After all, our teens and 20- somethings have made the biggest sacrifices during the <b>pandemic</b>, and they’ll be paying off <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> debt for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s in our national ethos, and interest, to get as many young people trained for the jobs of the future, to lift productivity growth, and run the economy faster to adjust to a rapidly ageing society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Removing barriers for young Australians to succeed in work, helping them build wealth and a stake in the housing market, and improve their <b>mental health</b>, is about as “on brand” as it gets for ­Albanese and Jim Chalmers, the boy from working-class Logan, in Brisbane’s south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine weeks after winning a paleo-diet majority with 33 per cent of the primary vote, Labor begins its parliamentary quest to revamp inclusion, while confronted with a budget morass it now owns and must explain to voters, because the political class contested an election on vibe, personalities and a fiscal chimera of prosperity on a stick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risk-averse Albo the campaigner is trying to shift into PM Large, telling this newspaper his legislative agenda will go beyond what Labor committed to during the campaign. That is hard to envisage within the budget constraint, although there has been a $40bn upturn in the underlying cash balance for the financial year that ended last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To wit, Albanese’s mandate involves providing cost-of-living relief, a promise of real wage growth, expanded childcare, skills training and support for manufacturing, and a mid-range emissions reduction target through more renewable energy that will soon face a political examination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On prevailing electoral demographics, and myopia, the major parties did not genuinely court young voters at the May poll. In fact, they opted to tilt advantage to homeowning Gen Xers and tax-exempt baby boomers in their sunset years. One of the few policy innovations Labor offered was its joint-equity housing scheme, targeting first-home buyers, those stranded after a divorce and low-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Help to Buy scheme would cover up to 10,000 loans a year for Australian citizens with a taxable income of up to $90,000 for individuals and up to $120,000 for couples. Labor said it would provide an equity injection of up to 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing affordability should trump temporary cost-of-living snarls in our political economy, yet it depends where you sit on the floor space-debt continuum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An over-eager Reserve Bank may now be saying “relax” about mortgage stress; the one-third of households with no debt and one-third who rent may well be. But with interest rates rising, and property prices tumbling, the borrowers with the smallest savings buffers and vulnerable to “negative equity” are likely to be recent entrants into the market: young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new <span class="companylink">OECD</span> report on housing taxation reveals how the game has changed, with home ownership rates plummeting by 40 pernetage points since 1981 for the bottom fifth of earners aged 25 to 34. “Younger generations will likely not be able to rely on housing as a vehicle for wealth accumulation in the same way that previous generations have done,” the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget is “dire”, claims the Treasurer, the savings identified amounting to a week’s worth of fiscal bingeing by the previous tenants. Chalmers will be making a declaration to parliament on Thursday, with new forecasts for inflation, growth and the budget (in the way, way-out years) likely to show a significant downgrade since the April pre-election update.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the resilient, if now very tight, labour market remains the nation’s best asset: 3.5 per cent unemployment and a 7 per cent rise in full-time jobs over pre-<b>pandemic</b> levels is a stunning achievement, the $1 trillion debt and the <span class="companylink">RBA</span>’s extraordinary foray into printing money and pumping up asset prices notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials are determined to lock in full employment, which is likely to be a 4 per cent jobless rate. “Underemployment has also declined in recent months and job vacancies are at historically high levels across most industries,” <span class="companylink">RBA</span> governor Philip Lowe told The Australian Strategic Business Forum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This all suggests that the growth in demand in the Australian economy is pushing up against the capacity of the economy to meet that demand,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s the context for macro policy “normalisation”, meaning the emergency has passed, with Chalmers switching into budget-repair mode and the <span class="companylink">RBA</span> trying to run the gauntlet of raising official interest rates without crashing the economy. Beating down demand, massaging inflation psychology, and maintaining confidence amid falling home values is the unenviable task as the global outlook sours. But that’s the job. Will the stewards nail a soft landing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Insight principal Chris Richardson says the labour force results “are magnificent numbers” for the nation. “What we don’t know is if they are sustainable. With interest rates rising, China cooling and commodity prices falling, that all makes it harder to sustain,” Richardson tells Inquirer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the lowest jobless rate since 1974 and best-ever workforce participation, there is a danger some of our most vulnerable young people are missing out, having been hit by the <b>pandemic</b>’s ­effects on their job-switching prospects, future earnings, educational attainment and <b>mental health</b>. Economists call it “scarring”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study by think tank e61 Institute, in partnership with the Paul Ramsay Foundation, found “early evidence of scarring on human capital accumulation, with a sharp increase in the share of young men who are not in employment, education or training during the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By using microdata on individuals, e61 identified four groups most vulnerable to long-term scarring effects. The authors say policies should be designed to break down barriers for young workers not well matched to their jobs; those who have not worked for a long time; men in their early 20s neither working nor studying; and students who have been disproportionately affected by school closures and remote learning E61 found that despite the recovery, long-term unemployment rates for young workers have been elevated since the global financial crisis and continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most notably, there has been a clear increase in the very long-term unemployed – young people who are unemployed for two years or more,” they write.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since the GFC, young workers have become more likely than older workers to be very long-term unemployed. This is surprising and potentially concerning given that many young workers will not have had the opportunity to even work for two years”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, a key indicator of youth disengagement is the share of people who are not in employment, education or training. Rising educational attainment caused the share of disengaged youth to decline over the 1990s and 2000s. Since the GFC, however, the share of people aged 20-24 that are neither working nor studying has stopped falling; during the <b>pandemic</b>, there was a notable increase in the share of disengaged males E61’s program director Dan Andrews tells Inquirer prioritising the preservation of jobs over labour mobility “entailed an implicit intergenerational trade-off”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over the first six months, JobKeeper shielded the intangible ­fabric of the economy by binding workers to firms,” says Andrews, a former <span class="companylink">RBA</span> and Treasury official and until recently the <span class="companylink">OECD</span>’s head of structural policy. “Overall, this was good for productivity but putting the economy in the deep freeze was highly disruptive to those on the cusp of major life transitions.” Andrews says this included young people relying on job mobility to overcome early career skill mismatches or <b>lockdown</b> affected sectors, such as hospitality, the “port of labour market entry”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly, those at key junctures in their education were particularly affected,” he says. “Young people lack voice in the political system, and there is a risk that they emerge as casualties of the <b>pandemic</b> once macroeconomic and immigration policy normalises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his address to our forum, Lowe said many of the challenges we face would be made easier by stronger growth in pro­duct­ivity. He said there’s a limit to pumping up demand: “The supply side matters too, and increasingly so.” Lowe has never wavered on this vital message, and perhaps the time for uplift will come, as scarcity closes in and a new team in Canberra searches for a new model to deliver a growth economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Stronger productivity growth means a bigger economic pie and higher living standards. It can also put downward pressure on prices and inflation,” Lowe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Further, strong productivity growth provides governments with a greater capability to fund the many services that the public values. And it is the only way to sustain stronger growth in real wages. The strategic challenge for us as a nation is to do what we reasonably can to lift our productivity growth. The good news here is that there is no shortage of ideas on how to do this.” What has been lacking is political will. Chalmers is talking more about the supply side, emphasising a switch in the October budget to spending that improves the productive side of the economy; the previous government, politically timid, and out of policy puff at the end of three terms and as many PMs, did not advance the ball on productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no opportunity society as Labor envisages it without a productivity dividend, which is spread across the whole community, but where the pain of adjustment is borne in the short-term by discreet groups of workers on the frontline of change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor’s Jobs and Skills Summit in early September will deal with some of these issues, but addressing entrenched disadvantage will require bespoke solutions, which are always expensive first up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While cost blowouts are front of mind, one of the least spoken about aspects of the National Disability Insurance Scheme is its workforce participation element. It would be surprising if this were not revived. It must be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">University of Melbourne</span> economics professor Jeff Borland says the best policy for assisting young people to get into work is by making growth in total employment as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just as young people are worst affected when the labour market slows, they benefit most when the labour market recovers,” Borland says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We saw this in the 1990s and we are seeing it again with employment growth for young people occurring more rapidly than for older age groups during the bounce-back from <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.” Last week’s labour force data shows the percentage of young people employed is now 6.1 percentage points above where it was in March 2020, compared to an increase of 2.6 percentage points for those aged 25 to 64 and 0.2 percentage point for those aged 65 plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Unfortunately, the experience is that a strong labour market is not likely to be sufficient by itself to get into employment groups of young people who face high barriers to obtaining work,” says Borland of those stuck in depressed regions or who have had their learning ­disrupted “Once you know the groups who are finding it difficult to get into work, then it’s possible to target policies at the barriers they are facing,” he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In very general terms, the types of policies that can improve employment outcomes are those that first give opportunities for young people to become job ready and improve their skills and, ­second, give opportunities to establish contact with work, for example, through career guidance and paid internship programs.” E61’s Andrews says the tendency for policy to excessively protect incumbents – at the expense of entrants – is an increasing problem in <span class="companylink">OECD</span> countries. We saw it during the crisis; we’ll never know how many potential great ideas or new firms were killed off by red tape or vested interests,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This new research is just another reminder of why young ­people need to be put at the heart of public policy,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pinpointing those most at risk, through better microdata, as e61 is calling for, will hopefully lead to superior policies for the dis­advantaged. They’re the ones we want to see bursting forth to a better life, by reaching their potential; for whom Albanese and Chalmers must speak and act for, having vowed to construct a wider entry to a world of opportunity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study covers lifetime <b>mental health</b>, noting that 44 per cent of Australians aged between 16 and 85, more than 8.5 million, have experienced a mental disorder at some time in their life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2020-21 it was just over one in five, or 4.2 million people, ABS head of health and disability statistics Linda Fardell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anxiety was the most common group of mental disorders – 16.8 per cent of all Australians had an anxiety disorder, 7.5 per cent had an affective disorder such as depression, while 3.3 per cent had a substance use disorder.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study also notes how people are trying to manage their <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some 17.5 per cent (3.4 million) of Australians had at least one consultation with a health professional for their <b>mental health</b> in 2020-21,” Ms Fardell said. “General practitioners were the most common type of health professional consulted.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 850,000 Australians accessed at least one digital service such as a crisis support line or counselling service for their <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women are more likely to seek support, the data shows, with more than one in five (22.8 per cent) seeing a health professional for their <b>mental health</b> compared with one in eight (12.2 per cent) for males.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s irresponsible for big corporates to “encourage” staff to work from home due to <b>Covid</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big corporate players who have gone harder than the public health advice and encouraged their office staff to work from home as this <b>Covid</b> winter wave takes hold want you to think they are being ­socially responsible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an opportunistic reach to masquerade social responsibility without a care in the world for the small business owners and retailers they’ll cripple on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a call to forge ahead with a work from home-friendly <b>Covid</b> ­policy, in a big old nod to the zoom class, is in fact deeply irresponsible and a fast track back to the dark days of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this winter wave takes hold, every day we are faced with doom­sayers who want to return to the dim days of lockdowns and misery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have to accept these kinds of weirdos will exist forevermore – some people just like living under a doona and would like everyone else to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, this week, seeing corporate ­giants like <span class="companylink">Telstra</span> and <span class="companylink">Westpac</span> issuing advice to encourage tens of thousands of staff to work from home was a concerning turning point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Alex Badenoch, a <span class="companylink">Telstra</span> group executive said in a statement: “We are strongly encouraging our people to work from home if they can, wear a mask when they can’t socially distance, and get their booster shot if they’re eligible.” <span class="companylink">Westpac</span> declared there was “no requirement to be in the office”. It came as <b>Covid</b> cases creep up to near record levels – but we must keep this in perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In NSW on Thursday there were just 55 people with <b>Covid</b> in intensive care units. We have the capacity for hundreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With massive vaccination rates the envy of the world and more than two years of knowing precisely what a <b>Covid</b> symptom looks like, we are more than equipped to manage ­ourselves without being “encouraged” to go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves from <span class="companylink">Telstra</span> and ­<span class="companylink">Westpac</span> followed updated advice from Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Kelly on Tuesday said the AHPPC “called on employers to allow work from home if feasible”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a mandate. It is not official NSW government policy. It is not even enforced national health policy.  Big corporates in <b>Australia</b> have long been masters of virtue signalling and moonlighting in social policy when they should be sticking the business of business. And here we go again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the decisions by <span class="companylink">Telstra</span> and <span class="companylink">Westpac</span> on retailers and small businesses as well as CBDs will be tangible. If other big corporates follow in their footsteps, it will be worse than tangible – it will be ­devastating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as we’ve started to breathe life back into our CBDs the last thing we need to do is encourage people to go home again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Albanese has been ­wisely measured on the topic. Pressed earlier this week on why governments won’t introduce stricter <b>Covid</b> mandates, he pointed to two things – <b>mental health</b> concerns of ongoing restrictions and our high vaccination rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed multiple times on whether businesses should send staff home, Albanese has refrained from issuing an edict, instead acknowledging ­businesses would make their own ­decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also acknowledged the bigger economic picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you’re a business that relies upon people coming into the CBD to shop, in retail or hospitality, then your business can be hurt by that as well. So it’s a matter of getting the balance right.” This is smart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course companies and employers should have the authority to try to manage outbreaks in teams and to protect their workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, if the NRL institutes a <b>Covid</b> bubble it would do so to save play. But a blanket call encouraging tens of thousands of office workers to go home is a different beast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It smacks of corporates making decisions that have little impact on them but a big impact on everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blended work weeks – like two days at home and three days in the ­office – are one of the benefits to workers which have come out of the <b>pandemic</b>. These are here to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small retailers and hospitality groups, who have already had to ­adjust to this and been knocked down time and time again, don’t need ­another blow on a corporate whim. Surely we are advanced enough now to stay home when you’re sick and go out when you’re not.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A DESPERATE Michael Slater called police for help after drinking in breach of his bail conditions, in an incident that ultimately saw him arrested and taken to court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Daily Telegraph can reveal police performed a welfare check at Slater’s unit in Manly late last Thursday night, which sources said came after they received a call from the cricketing legend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When officers arrived they called NSW Ambulance who took the 52-year-old to Northern Beaches Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, a NSW Police spokesman said Slater remained in hospital until Monday when he faced court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On Monday, 18 July he was escorted to Manly Police Station and charged with breach of bail, appearing at Manly Local Court the same day,” the statement read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magistrate Megan Greenwood found there had been a breach, but granted Slater bail again and ordered him to abide by the strict conditions of the arrangement. They include that he abstain from alcohol and drugs, be of good behaviour and not contact a number of women who have AVOs against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same court has previously heard Slater (pictured) had been receiving treatment for an alcohol use disorder and other <b>mental health</b> issues at Northern Beaches Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is currently facing charges including common assault and stalk/intimidate.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charges relating to those allegations were eventually dealt with under the <b>Mental Health</b> Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slater lost his job as a commentator at Channel 7 earlier in 2021 after he publicly attacked Scott Morrison on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> over not doing enough to get Australians home during the <b>pandemic</b>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More support is needed for teachers to travail life’s setbacks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NSW students have returned to school this week after holiday plans hampered by severe weather only to face a new wave of <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s a resigned inevitability to the cycle of gloom and disruption after four years of fires, floods and <b>pandemic</b> but we cannot accept constant challenge as the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NAPLAN results show ­Australian schools have emerged from the <b>pandemic</b> largely unscathed in terms of academic performance around numeracy and literacy, there are ­continued impacts on childhood development and wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers are seeing this first hand: increased anxiety, loss of social skills and pronounced behavioural issues in a cohort of school-starters who’ve spent half their lives isolated from the usual developmental opportunities that come with play and interaction with other children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life Ed (Healthy Harold) is the ­largest non-Government provider of preventative health education to Australian schoolchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bookings for our programs that cover social and emotional skills as well as cyber bullying are in high demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We recently conducted focus groups with teachers right across the country to find out what is troubling them the most. Student wellbeing was at the top of the list. The stories were consistent across the states and, in many cases, heartbreaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers told us about children standing on the sidelines of the playground, unsure of how to join in with basic games; of increased rough play; of increased bullying; of inappropriately mature language learned from too much time online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety in parents was broadly ­observed too. “We have parents coming to us daily for advice for their children’s <b>mental health</b> issues … we simply aren’t equipped for this,” one Year 5 teacher said. Let’s be clear. The wellbeing of our young has been under pressure well ­before <b>Covid</b>. The protracted <b>isolation</b> during the <b>pandemic</b> has simply exaggerated it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gonski report ‘Growing up Digital’ revealed that nine out of 10 teachers observed an increase in social and behavioural challenges in 2019 compared to five years earlier. The ­report focused on the correlation ­between the increasing amount of time spent by young people online and their emotional and physical health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not all screen time is bad for young people, their digital immersion deepened during <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s been no significant re-set, rather entrenched poor online habits have been accepted as the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to more comprehensively track and measure the wellbeing of children, especially those from areas of disadvantage where the developmental gaps are widest. The data to inform ­policy development is thin on the ground and largely anecdotal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the few sources of data around early childhood, the 2021 Australian Early Development Census, found that 44 per cent of NSW children were not developmentally on track when they started school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates dropped last year in key areas for the first time since 2009. Our school teachers are some of the best in the world but we cannot expect them to be to counsellors too. The ­circumstances in which they find ­themselves are unprecedented. The ­expectations on them are beyond their capacity. And many are stretched to a point of breaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NSW Government measures to reduce paperwork and administration for teachers are a much-needed start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scale of stress and uncertainty experienced by children, their families and school communities require multiple interventions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the forefront of this should be specialist curriculum-aligned support for teachers to ensure the mental ­well-being of “generation <b>Covid</b>” is our priority. Kellie Sloane is the CEO Life Ed <b>Australia</b></p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 YEARS TO GO! 2023 OUR time starts now. These four words celebrate the reality that we don’t need to wait ten years to enjoy the benefits of Brisbane 2032.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Games legacies can be enjoyed along a green and gold runway that starts today, that will take us to an opening ceremony in Brisbane in 2032, and then a decade beyond that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more than 30 major global sporting competitions coming to <b>Australia</b> along this runway and more are being added. This year alone we will see the Women’s World Cup in basketball, the World Road Cycling Championship and the World Short Course Swimming Championship come to our shores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year the Women’s World Cup in football, the Commonwealth Games in 2026, the Rugby World Cup for men in 2027 and women in 2029, and the list goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those 30-plus events, volunteers will be mobilised, sports communities activated, the world’s greatest athletes in their respective sports on display to inspire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New sports facilities will come online and importantly for Brisbane 2032, community facilities that will have an active life before playing their part in the Games – will be then returned to the community. And perhaps most importantly, young Australians and some not-so-young will be inspired to have a go at a sport that best suits their capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a go is an important first step for all of us to achieve and enjoy the many benefits sport can bring. Improving our physical health and our <b>mental health</b>. Bringing communities together and instilling pride. But without having a go in the first place, none of these benefits can be realised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s no question Brisbane and Queensland has embraced these Games and the opportunity it represents. But it is 10 years away and for many, perhaps a little over the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s why we are saying our time starts now. The organising committee has come together and planning is underway. Three levels of government are working well together. The business community has its head down to explore the possibilities over the next 10 years to make a lasting difference to Queensland and <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Importantly, for a Games to be successful, our Australian team must be successful. For that to happen, we need to invest in our sports to create opportunities today for the athletes of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian Olympic Committee and Commonwealth Games <b>Australia</b> have made a submission to government calling for a reset in the way government invests in sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our 10+10 strategy is designed to ensure that proper investment in sport now gives us success in 2032 and for 10 years beyond that. And it is an investment, not a handout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Success doesn’t happen with the flick of a switch. We must also support our athletes to ensure the success of Tokyo continues through Paris 2024, Los Angeles 2028 and through to Brisbane 2032. Once again, Our Time Starts Now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Olympic athletes want to make a difference too. We have seen the inspiration they provided through the gloom of <b>Covid</b>. Across Tokyo and Beijing, our teams energised and inspired our young athletes and communities right across Queensland and our country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month in front of 50 schoolchildren on Thursday Island, the <span class="companylink">AOC</span>’s “Olympics Unleashed” program passed a milestone with 250,000 students nationally now hearing directly from Olympians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reaching that mark on Thursday Island during NAIDOC Week was both a happy coincidence and an illustration of the <span class="companylink">AOC</span>’s commitment to reconciliation through sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been 60 known Indigenous Olympians. The group of 16 who travelled to Tokyo in 2021 was the biggest contingent of Indigenous Australian Olympians ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tokyo last year, Patty Mills became the first Indigenous flag bearer. He unified and energised the entire team in Tokyo and inspired Australians back home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That moment and Patty’s Boomers winning their bronze medal was magical. We want more Australians engaged and inspired to participate in sport and benefiting from that involvement. Our Olympic sports have something for everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The green and gold runway starts now. We can all “have a go” now. Our time starts now. IAN CHESTERMAN IS AOC PRESIDENT</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAREERS Compensation fears as rude Aussie workers forget how to deal with colleagues</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost three years of social distancing has left Aussie workers without the skills required to communicate appropriately with their colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too much time working remotely has caused many to “forget’’ their manners during face-to-face interactions, leading experts to fear a dramatic spike in claims for <b>mental health</b>-related workers’ compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centre for Corporate Health founder and psychological services director Rachel Clements says there has already been an increase in workplace reports of aggressive and inappropriate behaviour following <b>Australia</b>’s transition back to the workplace earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People have forgotten their social skills. They’ve forgotten they’re not on mute,” Clements says. “People are being rude to each other or they’re phrasing or wording things a little bit differently. Sometimes, there’s full-on conflict and yelling.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NO FILTER Clements says the stress of the <b>pandemic</b> has left workers feeling tired and burnt out, with little empathy for others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Working remotely for long periods of time reduces people’s empathy muscle – it really does,” she says. “People are saying what they think now, instead of stopping and thinking before they speak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Or they’re a bit more sensitive … and trying to read things into situations that aren’t there.” While Clements expects a significant increase in psychological injury claims in the coming year, she says other options are available to those with poor work-related <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says Resilient Me, an early intervention <b>mental health</b> program operated by CFCH’s sister company Resilia, can reduce workplace depression, anxiety and stress by more than 75 per cent and improve wellbeing by more than 40 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PEOPLE FIRST APPROACH Managing worker anxiety around returning to the office has been key to law firm Maddocks’ efforts to minimise fractious relations that can lead to psychological injury claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We said right from the beginning of the <b>pandemic</b> that our number one priority was our people’s <b>mental health</b>,” says people and culture director Deborah Stonley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“During the <b>pandemic</b>, people were dealing with issues of <b>isolation</b>, increased workloads, reduced social interaction and fatigue from managing working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are still issues as people are coming back to the office. We’ve had a staggered approach to returning to work so that we don’t all need to be in the office immediately but … people have been encouraged to head in on a day that their (immediate) colleagues are going to be there so they can reestablish those reconnections with each other.” <b>Covid</b>-safe work lunches and morning teas have helped to reacquaint staff, while managers have spoken openly about their own struggles in a bid to break down the stigma surrounding poor <b>mental health</b>, Stonley says. The proactive measures have seen calls to an employee assistance program return to pre-<b>Covid</b> levels, after tripling at the height of <b>pandemic</b> lockdowns, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>MENTAL HEALTH</b>’S STEEP DECLINE In Victoria, which endured the world’s longest <b>lockdown</b> during <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> restrictions, claims for compensation for psychological injury are expected to account for at least a third of all WorkSafe claims within the next decade, says personal injury lawyer Gabrielle Verhagen, from Gordon Legal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to be eligible for workers’ compensation, Verhagen says claims must include evidence the injury was a direct result of the complainant’s employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She warns the claims process can be lengthy and could further exacerbate a worker’s poor <b>mental health</b>. “Something workers need to weigh up (before proceeding with a claim) is whether (their health condition) will be a long-term condition and how much treatment and support they need,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If they only need short-term treatment and recovery (is quick) then maybe … they don’t want to go down that path (of lodging a compensation claim).” Regardless, all workplace incidents should be documented by the employee in case they decide to lodge a later claim, Verhargen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says assistance is available for those who do not have the financial means to seek professional advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managing <b>mental health</b> • Be aware of, and avoid the things that trigger your illness • Monitor your stress levels • Take tea and lunch breaks and, if necessary, go off-site to reduce stress • Exercise during your lunch break • Maintain your medication routine. Employers may be able to provide a private place for you to store or take your medication • Maintain a routine when you feel unwell • Develop a healthy way to release anger, such as an off-site walk, meeting with or phoning a friend during your breaks • Learn and use relaxation techniques • Use your network of family or friends, caseworker or community links • Maintain behaviour appropriate to the situation • If you are unwell or unhappy about something, speak to a trusted person in confidence      Source: headspace</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australians are increasingly jittery about the economy despite low unemployment levels, with more planning to hang on to the jobs they have as they grapple with the rising cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost half of the nation’s employees say they are struggling to meet their basic living costs, with petrol, housing and electricity their highest concern, a new study has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest quarterly employee sentiment index from software company <span class="companylink">ELMO</span> finds just 14 per cent rate the economy as secure, down from 19 per cent in the June 2021 quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising uncertainty is quickly putting paid to any notion of a Great Resignation in <b>Australia</b>, with the survey of more than 1000 Australian employees revealing a sharp drop in those considering a career change, down from 29 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 to 25 per cent in June. And fewer workers are actively seeking a new job, although the number of employees anticipating a pay rise within a year rose by six percentage points to 56 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost of living pressures are also having an adverse effect on their overall wellbeing, particularly for Generation Z workers, the survey finds. “However, employees in Gen Z are around twice as likely to be interviewing for a role with a new company than other generations, at 19 per cent (in the past three months) compared to millennials 12 per cent, Gen X 8 per cent and baby boomers 5 per cent,” the report states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">ELMO Software</span> chief executive Danny Lessem said the June quarter had seen a significant shift in employee priorities due to the broader economic conditions in <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The overwhelming feeling of uncertainty is prompting more employees to remain with their current employer with the expectation they will be rewarded for their contribution and loyalty,” Mr Lessem said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> continues to affect employer/employee relations and how jobs are done, the survey revealed a reversal of the trend of worker burnout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2021, 42 per cent of workers said they felt burnt out, a figure which had risen to 46 per cent by the March quarter this year. Now it is back to 42 per cent, but still worryingly high. More workers are prepared to take a <b>mental health</b> day, with 16 per cent reporting having done so in the past three months compared to 14 per cent in the quarter prior. “While most employers were encouraging the return to the ­office in recent months, it’s clear the cost of living pressures, which includes rising commuting and petrol prices, together with the colder winter months. means employees will favour more flexible, hybrid and remote working conditions,” Mr Lessem said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AGED CARE NEEDS HELP HAVING an elderly parent in an aged-care facility has been a difficult situation to deal with over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am certainly grateful to the nursing staff and other essential workers in my mother’s facility, and I would not begrudge any of them receiving the $750 <b>Covid</b> emergency payment that has been reinstated by the Albanese government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as your Editorial (C-M, Jul 18) noted, reports that staffing level rosters in the next few weeks could reach 30 per cent unfilled will have a severe impact on the care of vulnerable loved ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there are nurses who can be utilised from the ADF it is a no-brainer that they must be enacted again by the Albanese government. My parent’s <b>mental health</b> has been severely tested over the past six months. Continual lockdowns at her facility have had a dramatic effect on her <b>mental wellbeing</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being locked in her room due to just one <b>Covid</b> case in a 120-bed facility has in some ways been overkill, but understandable in the extreme measures that are needed to protect other residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the ADF can be used to address a nursing shortfall it is incumbent on the Prime Minister to ensure our elderly get through this third wave of an epidemic that regrettably targets them because of their age and circumstance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Henderson, Wynnum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE <b>Covid pandemic</b> was being controlled by our governments, protecting the people using best medical advice until the mercenary forces of crass capitalism overtook this balanced approach with the mantra of “freedom” from mandates and “let her rip” mentality that allowed <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> to thrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>Covid</b> incidence rate is alarmingly high and deaths continue to escalate, especially in the aged and disadvantaged sectors because of government failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science has all the answers but politicians only heed advice that is deemed politically advantageous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Max Tanzer, Elliott Heads</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS a retired pharmacist, aged 69, who has had four <b>Covid</b> vaccine shots, I unfortunately contracted <b>Covid</b> last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After deteriorating, I decided to bu my own antiviral at $1153, as I only had one approved condition and did not qualify for <span class="companylink">PBS</span> supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the enormous cost of having people in hospital, and health professionals run off their feet, why not give doctors more flexibility to prescribe drugs that could take the pressure off our collapsing and overburdened health workers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was able to stay out of hospital because the drugs worked so well. Is this another economic equation that our governments play – dollars versus sense?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Risitano, Coorparoo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">APPOINTEES REQUIRE MERIT HOT on the heels of the malodorous revelations about the integrity of state government practices and the political machinations of its members comes the revelation by the <span class="companylink">Grattan Institute</span> that 21 per cent of federal government appointees to responsible government entities are there as a result of “jobs for mates” (C-M, Jul 18).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering Australian governments are adept at taking the political high ground with foreign governments over human rights and corruption issues, these revelations make us look like hypocrites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some political appointees may be eminently qualified for some of these appointments due to their previous careers, the fact remains that in these cases a transparent, merit-based selection process has been usurped to provide a reward for service to the political incumbents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is bad policy because decision-making in entities controlled by political appointees is sometimes compromised, since difficult and often necessary decisions may not be implemented in the public interest but more in consideration of the desires of the appointee’s previous political affiliations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Societies should harness the talents and abilities of the most competent members, and it is only through merit-based selections for the leaders of society’s instrumentalities that the best decisions are made, leading to beneficial outcomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suggestion then that a review panel be established to scrutinise these appointments to government positions is timely and meritorious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoff Roberts, Brendale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABORTION PLOT IN response to the article “Abortion move by ministers” (C-M, Jul 18), the so-called “women’s ministers” would better serve all Australian women by not wasting time on shoring up their already deadly laws and instead support pregnant women who are constrained by circumstances or the antagonism of others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is these types of factors rather than ideology that drive most women towards abortion, but rarely do we see any recognition of this among many parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the reversal of Roe v Wade in the US, which simply returns the onus back to the states to decide on their laws, the abortion zealots here are driving in the opposite direction of ensuring federal support which is ultimately about ensuring federal funding for abortion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where this is a shortfall in state funding, the federal government will be expected to pick up the tab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would not most women be better served by seeking to provide services to support pregnant women and their families either through government departments or organisations largely run by volunteers who do not qualify for funds if they are philosophically opposed to abortion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems taxpayers’ money can only be directed to achieve one outcome which results in the death of an unborn human and the abandonment of others who are still left with the problems which initiated the initial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Donna Purcell, president, Cherish Life Queensland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRADIE SKILLS DRAIN IT was interesting reading about the low intake of tradies etc to do flood work and move to Queensland (C-M, Jul 18).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incentive is pitiful. Does the state government know how hard it is to get trade positions filled?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our youth were all pushed to be part of the “Smart State” and go to university etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, we have reaped what we have sown and we now have a lack of tradespeople. Offering incentives now is good but the pool of tradies for the foreseeable future is slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Dale, Oxley</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NO TIME FOR GROUP HUGS IF Mike O’Connor’s column (C-M, Jul 18) proves correct, federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers is embarking on a Brave New World campaign to control our very id.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems Labor is planning strategies to tell us when we’re happy, when we’re not and even if we’re a bit melancholy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one knows how they will achieve this, but you can bet it’ll cost megabucks. O’Connor tells us <b>New Zealand</b> Prime Minister, and head of Hobbiton, Jacinda Ardern has already tried and failed, so why would <b>Australia</b> want to follow suit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conducting group hugs isn’t going to help anyone, so don’t waste our time Mr Treasurer. Richard Marman, Meridan Plains</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the news that's fit to mint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's happening in (The) Oz today:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">🚗 ACT bans petrol cars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">🥶 Grab a blanket Victoria, it's about to get Victorian</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">🧑🏼‍⚕️ Nurses in NSW are not happy</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">👠 Julie Bishop is thriving post break-up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good morning!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In breaking news, it's cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it's winter but people in Victoria this morning may be waking up in a cold sweat as the <span class="companylink">Australian Energy Market Operator</span> is back with a fresh warning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Australian Energy Market Operator</span> (<span class="companylink">AEMO</span>) is saying the national electricity market faces a new crisis with looming gas shortages in Victoria which could cause a threat to \"system security\".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian - the cashmere throw to our electric blanket - reports that Lochard Energy's Iona gas storage facility in Victoria is on track \"to fall to an all-time low\" of just 6 petajoules on July 31 with the depletion of inventories leading to the risk of \"total system\" gas supply shortfalls for the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cool [sarcasm font].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cars are cancelled</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well ones that drink petrol will be in less than 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">ACT government</span> - different from the federal government that lives there - announced on Monday that by 2030, about 80 to 90% of new vehicles sold in the nation's capital will be zero emission vehicles. No new petrol vehicles will enter the market from 2035.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">instagram</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many people will replace their vehicles over the next 10 years,” the ACT's energy and emissions reduction minister Shane Rattenbury said. “We’re not going to take vehicles off the road, but we want to stop new petrol vehicles coming into the system to stop the problem getting worse; then, we can focus on transitioning those older vehicles out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone is tired</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But our front line healthcare workers are especially fatigued as <b>Covid</b> enters it's third year and we're told to expect another wave in mere weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, WA reached a milestone with its one millionth <b>Covid</b> case being recorded and with more than 400 people now in hospital, just 19 are in ICU, only two for <b>Covid</b> and none need a ventilator. The WA government is holding out on making masks mandatory again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile in Sydney about 60 nurses from two of western Sydney's biggest hospitals walked off the job on Monday morning to highlight staffing levels harming patient care with some nurses saying the hospitals are completely overcrowded at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anyone else who comes to Westmead here is going to be treated outside because there is no room inside,” a group of protesting nurses told Sky News as hospitals prepare for a wave of new infections to peak next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nurses at Blacktown hospital did the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">📍At the #nswnursestrike</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 3000 health workers are currently in <b>isolation</b> in NSW.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet then said the flu is “more severe” than current strains of <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest health data shows there have been 113 deaths from the flu out of 187,431 laboratory-confirmed cases in <b>Australia</b> this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, there have been 1383 deaths from more than 1 million <b>Covid</b> cases this month alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is likely that the flu season has already peaked, the new wave of <b>Covid</b> is yet to reach its highest infection rate, projected to peak in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cut it iso?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perrottet was taking no prisoners on Monday with regard to <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is also calling for a “balanced approach” when considering <b>isolation</b> requirements, advocating for a reduced <b>isolation</b> period at the end of the BA.4 and BA.5 wave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it stands you catch the spicy cough, see ya in seven days. Perrottet suggested maybe five days would be better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As we move through the next phase of the <b>pandemic</b> we need to balance out the competing health issues, … <b>mental health</b> issues, educational outcomes for our children, allowing people the opportunity to go to work,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Anthony Albanese didn't have a bar of it, saying now isn't the time to talk about cutting iso requirements as places like WA and SA will likely not experience their next <b>Covid</b> wave for six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albo isn't biting when it comes to cutting the iso debate. Yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul J. Keating would be so proud of you</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to new research, conducted by a Superannuation fund mind you, <b>Covid</b> has prompted a rethink among younger Australians when it comes to superannuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost half of the 18-34 year old Australians surveyed viewed their superannuation as more important now than since the start of the <b>pandemic</b>, according to a survey by super fund Equip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And nearly half of respondents overall (46%) have made voluntary super contributions, with as many as two in five starting to tip more in before they hit their 30s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equip CEO Scott Cameron said Aussies appeared to be taking their super more seriously from a younger age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Young Australians are thinking about their financial plans much more than they have previously,” Cameron said. “It is encouraging to see that younger people are prioritising their finances, and seeing value in contributing more to their super early in their careers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also revealed those under-35 were hit especially hard by the <b>pandemic</b>, with about a third losing working hours and almost one in seven losing their jobs or granted a leave of absence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, nearly a third had the opposite experience, 28% emerged from the <b>pandemic</b> with greater income. While 27% emerged with more disposable income than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Bishop's ick factor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Bishop - former Foreign Minister, the woman who made partner of a massive law firm, represented asbestos manufacturer James Hardie then climbed the ranks of the Liberal party and became its deputy federal leader for more than 10-years - broke up with her longterm boyfriend, David Panton. But she's fine. She is booked and busy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So fine she managed to turn a cringe TV interview into a promo for her latest corporate gig as an \"ambassador\" for Perth-based mining company <span class="companylink">Mineral Resources</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how does a successful woman heal from heart break. I hear using $100 bills earned from your plethora of post political jobs and board appointments helps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie and David reportedly broke up when he took her out to dinner recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile this guy is going to fight for his ex</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Literally.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Scott Morrison wasn't a politician, he would be a pastor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison has delivered a sermon where he warned people about \"Satan's plan\".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is worried <b>Australia</b> has been gripped by worry because of the <b>Covid pandemic</b> and said he \"still believes in miracles\" despite the wipe out loss of his government at the Federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morrison spoke for more than an hour in Perth at the weekend on the invitation of tennis star Margaret Court, the founder of the church who is celebrating her 80 birthday, where he also helped officially open her new Victory Life Church headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday Morrison urged parishioners to trust in God above all else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"We trust in Him. We don't trust in governments. We don't trust in the United Nations, thank goodness,\" Morrison said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morrison's rhetoric while addressing Church congregations would not be surprising or shocking to fellow attendees. This language and teaching is the standard for majority of people watching, listening or streaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Morrison speaking at a guest at Margaret Court's Church. Picture: 9 News</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also spoke at length about the rising rates of <b>mental illness</b> in <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morrison highlighted there were “biological issues” or “brain chemistry” that resulted in clinical disorders and sought to link the everyday anxieties to a spiritual deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morrison added that if people \"gave into\" their worries, they were resigning themselves to \"Satan’s plan\"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“God knows that anxiety is part of the human condition,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He drew parallels between God’s “engagements” and how counsellors address <b>mental health</b> before declaring if you had faith in God’s plan you didn’t need to worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No matter how [secular people] might seek to deny it, or even dismiss it, the truth of God stands up and shines,” Morrison said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first time Morrison had visited WA since his election defeat. A loss that came from the overwhelming rejection of the government as the results saw a massive swing from voters away from the Liberal party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He confirmed his acceptance to appear alongside Court - a divisive public figure due to her anti-gay views - was done so in a \"private capacity\". However, Morrison is still an MP and when parliament starts next week he will be an opposition backbencher earning a publicly funded pay cheque of more than $180,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we wasn't a politician, he'd be a pastor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of the election back in May Morrison sat down with The Oz and told us exclusively that if he wasn't in politics, he would be a preacher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"I probably would have been a church pastor,\" Morrison, a proud Pentecostal Christian, said while adding that you didn't need to be loved to be a good PM, but had to be \"respected and be strong and listen\".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">#scottmorrison says he felt misunderstood on the issue of women, which has been identified as central to his election defeat. This interview has been abbreviated. Read more from the interview on theoz.com.au</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His address in front of churchgoers in Perth is not entirely surprising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morrison made his final ever public comments as Prime Minister in the confines of his regular Church in Sydney's Sutherland Shire the day after the election loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Jenny and I and the girls are very grateful to our church family here,” Morrison said back in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’ve given us a great foundation from which we could walk what has been a very difficult walk, I’ve got to tell you, over the last four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whether you’re a prime minister, a pastor, running a business, teaching in schools, working in the police force, it doesn’t matter. We’re each called to trust and obey. And that’s the life of faith He calls us to. That’s how we live our faith each and every day, regardless of what your job is, and to express it in how you do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also quoted from the Bible and was seen to wipe away tears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret Court has a church?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After her world-recording breaking tennis career Court leaned in hard to her faith (something she also never shied away from during her playing days).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>’s greatest ever tennis player established the Victory Life Church in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Following a call from God to establish a word of faith (and) Pentecostal ministry in the Perth area. Our Vision is to train an army of people who know Christ from within, to take this city and nation for Jesus,” the Church’s website states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentecostal church’s new five-story prayer tower, which was approved for construction back in 2018, opened at the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Court has been a vocal supporter of the former PM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Australian tennis player Margaret Court now runs a Church in Perth where ScoMo held court at the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her husband Barry is a former Liberal party president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in February she publicly prayed Morrison would be re-elected and she previously defended him during his family holiday to Hawaii as bush fires ravaged NSW.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12-months to June 2021, Court's Church received $365,000 in taxpayer dollars - which was the last full financial year of Morrison’s Prime Ministership - and is exempt from tax as all churches are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also received $283,000 worth of Government funding and grants over the 2019-20 financial year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victory Life Treasurer James Chan revealed in August last year the Church also collected $500,000 through the Morrison government's JobKeeper scheme to support its 12 full-time and 13 casual employees.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Social distancing and handwashing should have been continued and mask wearing and good ventilation should also be observed,” Professor Booy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In <b>Australia</b>, you can have the windows open even in winter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b> is grappling with the spread of the highly infectious BA. 4 and BA. 5 sub-variants and more than 38,000 cases were reported nationally on Sunday, with 10,198 in NSW and 9630 in Victoria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Australian National University</span> infectious disease physician Peter Collignon said people between the ages of 20 and 40 were more likely to contract <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> than school-aged children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Collignon said measures such as mask wearing, temperature checks and regular rapid antigen testing in schools would not make much of a ­difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s all to do with decreasing risk for adults but this whole ­theory that children are the super spreaders is garbage,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Child and adolescent psychologist Clare Rowe says the <b>Covid pandemic</b> and lockdowns were the \"last straw\" when it came to children's <b>mental health</b> issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comes after The Daily Telegraph reported the NSW government has been forced to set up a hotline for teachers to call counsellors if worried about their students amid a spike in depression and emotional issues exacerbated by the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"We discussed some reports at the end of last year that came out that has shown the dramatic increase of kids being prescribed antidepressants, and they were of primary school age,\" Ms Rowe told Sky News host Chris Kenny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"It is really concerning; I think we throw millions and millions of dollars at <b>mental health</b>, we do it every year - the budget gets bigger and bigger, and yet our kids are the most anxious and depressed than they've ever been before.\"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It will be good to go back to school and we’re just hoping there won’t be any impact from this new variant,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re still encouraged to wash their hands regularly and to practise good hygiene.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chloe and Edith were both excited to be going back – especially Edith who is looking forward to a school disco just days before her seventh birthday – but said <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> was still a part of everyday life in the classroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don’t have to wear masks anymore but we try to, it’s encouraged,” Chloe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But my teacher still wears a face mask all the time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Deakin University</span> chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett said the mix of variants and the number of reinfections meant it was hard to model the latest crop of outbreaks but she didn’t see a need to single out schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said preventive measures such as staying home, reducing densities in shared work and study spaces, and retail and hos­pitality workers wearing masks would reduce transmission ­overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If these changes are made widely enough, it will also make a difference at the population level as well,” she said. “I don’t see a need to single out any specific setting for rules when the transmission dynamic links all locations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Education Minister Jason Clare said he encouraged families to follow the health advice that had been issued in their state or territory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From my medical practice in Riverstone, I am watching a health emergency play out in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some patients and members of the community are still yet to finish rebuilding their homes and lives from the floods that swept through our suburbs in March, we were hit again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one patient, it’s the third time he’s been impacted by flooding in 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet again, patients were stranded at home because of flooded roads, others evacuated to friends and families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the impacts go much further than the immediate and very real and immediate dangers of flooded rivers, streets and homes, or the lost power and contaminated water sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m worried about my patients who have missed appointments because they couldn’t leave their homes or reach the practice – necessary routine care has been delayed for some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also worry about the impacts of all this water on the homes – mould can be extremely harmful for patients with asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases. Those who are facing this latest flooding are mentally and physically exhausted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pounding rain and forecasts of another La Nina system next summer are additional stresses for a weary community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing <b>mental health</b> impact of repeated extreme weather events is well-documented – our <b>mental health</b> services are already stretched, but they will be needed more and more as the community deals with this event and prepares for the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our health sector – both hospitals and in primary care – is also stretched, dealing with the ongoing influenza and <b>Covid</b> patients. Health workers are also struggling mentally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The compounding impact of cost of living pressures that contribute to more people living in riskier areas – on flood plains, further into bushfire-prone areas – and the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events is very concerning to doctors and healthcare workers like me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people most affected by these events are too often the people who can least afford to rebuild or move elsewhere. With insurance premiums too expensive, some are uninsured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of my patients affected by flooding were only a couple of short years ago battling the toxic smoke from Black Summer bushfires and scorching heatwaves in homes that weren’t built well enough to protect them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know that climate change fuelled by the burning of fossil fuels increases the likelihood of intense rainfall that, in turn, increases the chances of flash flooding. We also know that it increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and bushfires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can see the direct impact of climate change on my patients. It is harming their health, safety and livelihoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All levels of government need to act decisively to prepare our most at-risk communities for these events. Dealing with these extremes is our new reality, and we should be doing more to adapt, support and prepare the community. We cannot afford to build in known flood zones. We need strategies in place for building communities that are not urban heat islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We require the political will to do this. Our leaders also need to act rapidly to reduce emissions this decade in order to protect people, our environment and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b> can take the lead in investing in renewable energy to reduce our reliance on coal and gas, creating jobs and making the environment safer for us all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we don’t address climate change, the costs will only increase to the economy, the environment, and, most importantly, our health. Dr Kim Loo is a Western Sydney doctor and NSW chair of Doctors for the Environment <b>Australia</b>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the more lingering side effects of the <b>Covid pandemic</b> in <b>Australia</b> is not to do with our physical health, but our <b>mental health</b>. Amid increased anxiety and <b>isolation</b>, demand for <b>mental-health</b> services skyrocketed, meaning one in three psychologists are now unable to take on new patients – compared to one in 100 prior to the first lockdowns.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Albanese government is learning very quickly that it was much easier taking a position on <b>Covid pandemic</b> management from the opposition benches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <b>Australia</b> moves into yet another phase of rising <b>Covid</b> cases, the government will be called on to examine <b>pandemic</b> regulations to determine whether there needs to be any adjustments. In opposition, the Labor Party was quick to fire salvos, often contradictory ones, and respond to social media “expert” commentary, when it judged the Morrison government had taken missteps. Of course that is the business of being in opposition but as we drew closer to the federal election, the claims of <b>Covid</b> mismanagement increased and were completely devoid on any consideration that these were unprecedented times. This week’s address of former prime minister Scott Morrison about how <b>Australia</b> had weathered the <b>pandemic</b> better than most, came at an opportune time. It refocused attention on the things the Australian government did right, and reminded the electorate that the narrative about poor <b>Covid</b> management was not based on fact. It also underscored the increasing pressure on the new government and its management of a <b>pandemic</b> that won’t just go away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the health front, the Prime Minister is already facing new pressures from the medical fraternity to reintroduce unpopular mask mandates and deal with chronic shortages of medical professionals and over-run wards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question of vaccination mandates across a range of professions is being asked again, with schools and aged-care facilities poised to relax regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of those decisions are bound to elicit criticism from quarters of the community still terrified about the impact of <b>Covid</b> on the elderly and on vulnerable young people. On the social front, he already backed down and is keeping the emergency <b>Covid</b> payments, which had to balanced against the rising national debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To deal with the concerns, Mr Albanese will reconvene the national cabinet today, two days early, and this will be his first real test at managing the unruly states. He is also in the driver’s seat now when it comes to balancing the health of the community against the knowledge that the electorate had probably had enough of being told what to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These issues are no easier to navigate now than they were two years ago, but in terms of the community’s freedoms, Mr Albanese has to try to stand firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither the economy nor the community’s <b>mental wellbeing</b> can weather another phase of <b>lockdown</b>, restrictions and mandates. The government itself forecast the number of people catching <b>Covid</b> would number in the millions over the coming weeks, and that’s a scary number. But Mr Albanese needs to resist some of the hysterical commentary and recognise we are far more familiar with our enemy now than we were, and that we are in a better place to deal with it without over-reacting.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial services giant <span class="companylink">Citi</span>’s global human relations chief reveals how the company is balancing the need for staff to return to the office while retaining maximum workforce flexibility. Exclusive story by Glenda Korporaal America’s Great Resignation, in which millions of workers quit their jobs due to the <b>Covid pandemic</b>, may be peaking out as workers become ­increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, according to the global head of human relations for banking giant <span class="companylink">Citi</span>, Sara Wechter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with The Weekend Australian during a visit to Sydney, Ms Wechter said there were some early signs workers in the US were now thinking twice before they quit their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It (the Great Resignation) hasn’t plateaued fully yet, but I see it starting to come down,” she said. “With the concern about whether there is going to be a recession in Europe and how it might impact the US, people are getting more cautious and want to see what’s happening.” A record 47 million American workers quit their jobs last year in the wake of the <b>Covid pandemic</b>. Some have attributed it to the desire for more work-life balance as well as a demand for more pay when the economy has bounced back strongly. Others have argued that it is also a natural reaction to job-hopping being put on hold during lockdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of people voluntarily leaving their jobs in the US reached a monthly high of 4.5 million in March. The US unemployment rate is now down to 3.6 per cent, with post <b>pandemic</b> hiring continuing strongly in many industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the number of people leaving or changing jobs in the US was down to 3.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Wechter said <span class="companylink">Citi</span> had been hiring new workers in the US and around the world. It put on 75,000 people over the past year, taking its total to 240,000. A third of its workforce is in the US.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Its Australian headcount has just halved to 800 with the sale of its retail bank to <span class="companylink">NAB</span>.) “We’ve been actively hiring (in the US) and we have not had an issue recruiting,” she said. “We have had multiple people applying for every job.” Ms Wechter said there were still “hot spots” of worker shortages in areas like IT specialists, including markets technologists, in which it is hiring to help move its institutional clients online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Citi</span> has also doubled its number of in-house recruiters to deal with the new hirings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Wechter said the Great Resignation was a reaction to the fact that many people had had to stay in their jobs during <b>Covid</b>, uncertain about the future. “There was a lot of pent-up demand by workers to look outside (for jobs) and see what else was going,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We saw an increased attrition rate as <b>Covid</b> started to come down.” But she said attrition rates were now starting to ease back. “There are still areas like market technologists (where attrition) hasn’t slowed down yet. But I am seeing more people having the debate with themselves: ‘Am I going to leave? Is this the right time?’ ” Ms Wechter said the increase in interest rates in the US this year was also giving workers some pause for thought about throwing in their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been a long time since we have had mortgage rates above 5 per cent,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is new territory for a whole group of people. It is creating a pause while people are watching to see what happens.” With its US workforce now back in the office, <span class="companylink">Citi</span> has an official policy that they must be at their office at least three days a week. She said the bank had a clear view that once <b>Covid</b> restrictions in each country were lifted, its workers needed to be back in the office the majority of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The vast majority of our roles will be hybrid, going forward,” she said. “What that means for us is being in the office three days a week and having the ability to work remotely two days a week.” “We’ve done that consistently, globally.” She said there were a small percentage of jobs such as call centres which could be done permanently from home, while others such as bank tellers needed to be in the office five days a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said top managers from <span class="companylink">Citi</span> chief executive Jane Fraser down were now deliberately moving to having in-person meetings of their teams. “We started to do a lot of things in person again, including board meetings,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Jane has her management team on Tuesday morning. She wants everyone in. It’s starting to happen pretty consistently now the office is open and it is trickling down the organisation. People are using the common spaces again.” Ms Wechter admits that the mandatory policy of three days in the office has caused complaints from some workers who want to spend more time working from home. But she argues that <span class="companylink">Citi</span> is being transparent about its policy and believes that people need to have a regular commitment to being in the office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think it’s really important for apprenticeship and culture,” she said. “We have 75,000 people we hired last year who had never seen a <span class="companylink">Citi</span> employee. It’s hard to work in an environment where you’ve never met a (fellow) employee.” She said the policy of mandating at least three days in the office had been reached after much internal debate. “We talked a lot about those things. At the end of the day, frankly, that is what we stand for as a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can appreciate that there are some people who that may not work for, but this is what we are going to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Human interaction makes the world work. You need to have human interaction during the day to be happy and feel accomplished.” She said that while Fridays was the day with the least amount of workers coming into the office, there were still those workers who preferred it as the commute times into offices, particularly in Manhattan, were lower with fewer workers coming into the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Wechter said the different teams on the bank were putting on special events to welcome people back to the office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Wechter, whose sister used to run <span class="companylink">Citi</span>’s retail bank in <b>Australia</b>, is making her first swing through of the Asian region since the <b>pandemic</b> now that countries such as Japan, Singapore and <b>Australia</b> have opened up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank has started taking its new graduates in <b>Australia</b> to <span class="companylink">Citi</span>’s head office in New York or to its London office for training courses. She said this had led to having the ground floor “Town Square” area of the bank’s headquarters in Manhattan full of many young workers from overseas, as well as the usual summer interns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multistorey atrium and amenity space was opened in 2019, uniting two buildings in the Tribeca area in lower Manhattan which were renovated and connected to create the bank’s global headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for it to become a vibrant place to encourage employees to interact and collaborate were hit by <b>Covid</b> which broke out in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Wechter said the area was again coming to life in the current US summer. “They had a DJ and we had speeches by executives. It was like a party down there,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Wechter said the <b>pandemic</b> had created <b>mental health</b> issues for some. “<b>Covid</b> didn’t help from a <b>mental health</b> standpoint,” she said. “It led to <b>isolation</b> and people losing their jobs. People need routines. When you don’t have any routine because you are not waking up to go to something, it is not good for your <b>mental health</b>.” <span class="companylink">Citi</span> insists that its employees are vaccinated unless they have a special exemption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a supplier to the federal government it is required to comply with a Biden administration mandate that its staff are vaccinated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It became very clear that we had to have a vaccinated workforce,” she said. “We gave people months. We communicated. We did everything we possibly could. We ended up with fewer than 100 folks who either didn’t get vaccinated or didn’t have an (exemption).” Ms Wechter said while employees may not agree with the bank’s policies on the mandatory three days a week in the office and other policies, it is important for an employer to be clear and public about their views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said if <span class="companylink">Citi</span> had announced a hybrid policy of three days a week in the office in 2019 before the <b>pandemic</b>, when most people were working full time in the office, it would have been welcomed as a bold move towards more flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now everyone’s been at home for two years so that’s your starting point.” “We are trying to give as much clarity and transparency as we can about what the new normal will look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have tried to be very definitive about it so that people can make their choices about what works for them and their families.” <span class="companylink">Citi</span> is also moving to assist employees who may by affected by the <span class="companylink">US Supreme Court</span>’s recent decision to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade decision which found that American women had a constitutional right to an abortion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision now causes problems for those women in states where abortion is banned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Citi</span> employees in the US are covered by the company’s health insurance policy which allows for staff to travel if they need to get specialist healthcare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said <span class="companylink">Citi</span> had already decided last year that if Roe V Wade was overturned, it would allow for any affected staff to travel to an abortion in another state where it was legal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have had abortion as part of our healthcare plans for decades at <span class="companylink">Citi</span>,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year, we changed our benefits plan to allow abortion to be one of those things covered by the travel benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We saw a lot of companies coming out with travel benefits for abortion after the announcement, but we had one in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We did it to reinforce that we will continue to provide benefits around family planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We will try to equalise it in the US wherever we are legally allowed.” “</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s currently the reality for about 1750 Australians, while thousands more have experienced it before them – and thousands more will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Kate Wyburn, president-elect of the Transplantation Society of <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand</b>, describes the waiting list as “a dynamic, complex structure that people come on and come off for all sorts of reasons”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s certainly not a chronological list where you start at the top and work your way down,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A computer algorithm matches organs with patients, taking into account factors such as the urgency of the patient getting the transplant, how difficult the patient is to find a match for, and how good a match the organ is for the patient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger recipients are also prioritised, Prof Wyburn says, as it’s particularly important for them to have better long-term outcomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The wait times can differ enormously,” she says. “Liver, heart and lung transplants are driven a bit more by medical urgency. If you’re waiting for a kidney transplant, there’s an option to stay on dialysis until the optimal match can be found.” Associate Professor James Olver, a consultant psychiatrist within the Austin Hospital’s liver and intestinal transplant unit in Melbourne, says those on the waitlist can face multiple <b>mental health</b> challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include “dealing with uncertainty and helplessness” surrounding their fate, and feeling isolated as worsening physical health prevents them from working and socialising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(There is also) fear deteriorating health may lead to them being excluded from being a transplant candidate, which is devastating, or that they could die waiting for a transplant,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further issues present themselves post-transplant, among them survivor’s guilt. “Patients often feel deep empathy for the family of the donor,” Olver says. “Often our patients have also developed friendships with other people on the waiting list and when they get their transplant, are painfully aware a bunch of their friends are still waiting.” Other post-transplant challenges can include patients thinking about how they will rebuild their lives, dealing with complications from the surgery and effects of new medications, and coming to terms with the fact “there’s a foreign organ inside their body”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, three Australians who have been, or are still on the waiting list share their experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOUISSA CHALK Louissa Chalk sees herself as “an unlucky lucky one”. The Brisbane mum, 48, says she was lucky to receive a lifesaving new heart five years ago. But she’s unlucky that the nine-hour transplant surgery caused her other organs to fail – her kidneys permanently, landing her back on the waitlist, where she remains 3½ years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalk was unlucky to have been born with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which has caused her to suffer two sudden cardiac deaths at ages 12 and 23. She was clinically dead for eight minutes during the second one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she considers being told, after the first attack, that she may die in her early 20s “a blessing”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I really appreciated every single day,” she says. “And I did die when I was 23 … but I was super lucky I was at the gym with my sister who knew all about my condition, my friend who’s a cardiac nurse and a gym instructor who knew how to do CPR.” Chalk ended up in a coma and suffered short-term memory loss – but she recovered and married, continued indulging a passion for travel and had son Caleb, now 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by age 43, her condition deteriorated again to the point where she needed a new heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her 5½ month wait was filled with “living in the moment”, quality family time, and tough conversations. “My son asked me if I was going to die,” she recalls. “I had to be honest and say, ‘I don’t know if I’ll receive a heart in time, but hopefully I do.” She did, but that was hardly the end of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now I’ve been waiting 3½ years for a kidney,” she says. “I’m on dialysis three times a week. I haven’t been able to work. My son does a lot of helping in our home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The longer it takes, the harder it is to keep waiting. And you’re constantly waiting. You carry your phone around with you all the time. Every time (it rings), you think ‘this could be it’.” When the call came the first time, Chalk recalls being “overwhelmed with conflicted emotions”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Somebody’s died, so you think ‘that poor family’,” she says. “And that was the only time I started to feel scared. It’s no small thing, going into a surgery knowing they’re going to cut your chest open and remove your heart.” Chalk and Caleb are working with DonateLife and the Organ and Tissue Authority on a book called Shared Heartbeat, aimed at helping families discuss organ donation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The way to approach it is remembering we have an opportunity to give this priceless gift to somebody who desperately needs it when we no longer do,” she advises. “It costs us nothing, and it gives so much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m grateful every day. And I talk to my young donor every day. I say to them, ‘I’m so sorry you’ve ended up in the body of a 43 year old. But I’ll do my best to still have fun’.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PENNY HAMILTON Penny Hamilton recalls her three months on the waiting list for a new heart as a “dark time”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She joined the list on July 31, 2021, when Victoria – where the 65 year old lives about 2½ hours north of Melbourne in Shepparton – was in the grip of <b>Covid</b> restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a few months earlier, cardiology specialists at The Alfred Hospital had told Hamilton her heart failure was so severe that without a transplant, she only had one to two years to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I cried and I got angry and I got silent,” she recalls. “But they did offer me a lifeline.” A 2014 diagnosis of non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy set Hamilton on the path to requiring a transplant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medication and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker kept her in reasonable shape until she noticed, on a 2019 trip to Ireland, that she couldn’t keep up with her travelling companions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhaustion and breathlessness Hamilton felt escalated until, in January 2021, she “went down in a heap”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My blood pressure was so low they thought I was going to die,” she recalls. “I was weak, fatigued, had brain fog. For those who have had <b>Covid</b>, that’s what people on the transplant waitlist feel like all the time.” She was moved from hospital to hospital until landing at The Alfred in Melbourne, suffering the “trauma” of having her defibrillator misfire “10 times in a row” along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It felt like a horse was kicking me,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamilton was discharged from The Alfred feeling “so weak … I was using a Zimmer frame to walk” and experiencing severe nausea that made it difficult for her to eat – but also motivated to be healthy enough to pass the “workup” required to make the waitlist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This involves comprehensive testing to ensure the transplant surgery has the greatest chance of success. She passed, then the anxiety-riddled wait began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had to learn to carry my phone everywhere – it was life or death,” she recalls. “I talked to a psychologist, a hypnotherapist, I read books on how to relax. But nothing relaxed me.” Hamilton also had to wrestle with the fact “someone has to die for you to live”. When she received “the call”, she was both “delighted and frightened”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and husband Geoff barely talked on the drive to Melbourne, but they did hold hands most of the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Covid</b> restrictions meant they were unable to be together again until her discharge a few weeks after her seven-hour surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her recovery has been slow, but she says she has “so much more energy now”. She has also found “marvellous” support through <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group Together in Transplant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamilton has now registered as a donor “for everything except my heart” – “I thought, no one wants a third-hand heart,” she says. She urges others to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I often think of my donor and their family. Words can’t really express how grateful I am,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(My donor) gave me life. I’m 65 and I’d like to have a couple more decades of living life, doing art, enjoying my friends.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARON HOSKIN A week before Sharon Hoskin’s 31st birthday, her world came crashing down. After suffering a debilitating flu and shortness of breath, the South Australian mum was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and told she had five to eight years to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was a single mum with four small children,” Hoskin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I smoked, drank coffee and cried. I knew it was bad, but that’s all I did for five weeks.” Now less than a week from her 55th birthday, Hoskin is “loving life” and grateful to have received a lifesaving heart transplant. Her left hand even bears a tattoo “in honour of my donor” to serve as a reminder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medication and regular testing kept her in good shape following the shock diagnosis. But in her late 30s, she ended up in hospital with a pacemaker and an implanted defibrillator after “almost passing out at work”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When my first granddaughter was a month old, I had my first shock from the defibrillator,” she recalls. “If I didn’t, I would have died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I went on to have 17 more shocks.” Hoskin says from there, she “deteriorated over the years” and was told she needed a transplant after suffering chest pains, vomiting and enduring multiple shocks one night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was officially placed on the waitlist at age 51 – about five months after starting the workup to ensure she was healthy enough for a transplant. The process involved having all her teeth removed and replaced with false teeth to nullify the risk of gum infection, which had the potential to damage her new heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That was traumatic,” she says. “But they wouldn’t put me on the list until I’d done it.” After just eight days on the list, a new heart was found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(While on the waitlist) my phone was on me constantly. Even at work it was in my hand, which was usually a no-no,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I slept with it, I went to the bathroom with it. Every time it rang, I jumped. “I was also terrified. I never use the word ‘goodbye’, but I rang all my children and said goodbye, because I believed I wouldn’t make it.” Hoskin was almost right – after her four-hour surgery, doctors contemplated turning her life support off. But she rallied and was discharged two weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to this “miracle”, Hoskin is now enjoying life with husband Chris, her four kids and five grandkids (set to be six by year’s end), and working full time as a manager in a jewellery store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes, a lot of bad stuff happened,” she says. “Yes, I have all these diseases now, but I’m still here. Give me diabetes, swollen legs and not great kidneys – they’ve told me I will need (a new kidney) one day, but I don’t care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I feel euphoric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I feel that from someone’s tragedy, something wonderful happened.” She urges Australians who aren’t registered to be organ and tissue donors to take the 60 seconds required to do so, and then let their family know their wishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why take your organs when you don’t need them, when you can save so many people’s lives?” she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queenslander Lara Einzig took up surfing as a form of healing and was then inspired to write a book celebrating the world’s female surfers The rituals of summer. The car pack. Esky in the boot, boards on the roof, and arguments in the back seat all the way up – or down – the coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beach house arrival, the bagsing of rooms and unpacking of togs, the race to the beach, and the first glimpse of the white frills breaking on sand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mornings spent beneath the sun, afternoons in retreat from it; board games, books and lazy siestas. Night-time games of hide and seek in the dunes, and sky blue dreams on sandy sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many Australians, the annual beach holiday looks remarkably the same the nation over and, for Lara Einzig, the imprint of her family’s Queensland summers is etched deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Einzig, 44, latterly of Venice, California, but originally from Mackay, Queensland, the beach is where her strongest childhood memories lie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also (as it is for so many of us) a place of healing; the ocean where we head in times of grief, to walk beside the sea in search of solace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Einzig, author of Women Making Waves, a celebration of women’s surfing, lost her younger sister Julia to <b>mental illness</b>, she headed to the place where all her best memories of her sister could be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We grew up (Einzig, her sisters Anna, now 49, and Julia, who was 32, and parents Jeff and Judy Kuhnemann) in a small beach community about 20 minutes out of Mackay called Bucasia,” Einzig says from her Californian home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was a short path from our house to the beach, it was pretty flat, no surf at all, and we had to wear bright stinger suits, but it still had that beach feel, that beach vibe, and it was there that our collective love of the ocean was fostered.” When Einzig was 14, the family moved to Brisbane and spent their summers on the Sunshine Coast, “all the kids piled on to mattresses, all the cousins running amok in the dunes”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My grandparents had a beach house in Caloundra, and later my dad (then in real estate) built a house at Warana Beach. When we stayed with our grandparents, they’d take their cars out of the garage and we’d all sleep on its floor. There were kids everywhere,” Einzig chuckles, “it was wonderful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’d wake up just frothing to get into the surf, and our parents’ rule was ‘between 12 and 3, under a tree’, but then we’d head straight out into the waves again.” It was, she says, an idyllic Australian childhood, but while all the boys in the group surfed, it never really occurred to Einzig or her sisters, or any of her female cousins at the time, that they should, or even could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be years later that Einzig would tuck her own surfboard under her arm and take her place in the line up. It would be later still that she would write a book in homage to all the women in all the line-ups globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women Making Waves is also dedicated to Julia, the reason, Einzig says, she learnt to surf, and who is still by her side in the waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I was growing up, we just didn’t see women surfers, except for the professionals like Pam Burridge or Layne Beachley,” Einzig says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I finished school (at Brisbane’s Stuartholme), I did a business and marketing degree at QUT (<span class="companylink">Queensland University of Technology</span>), packed up my car and moved to Sydney, and then in my early 20s, like a lot of other young Aussies, I headed to London.” Then working in fashion marketing, Einzig met her now husband Dan, and father to their three children Raphael, 12, and twins Flynn and Louis, 9. When the twins were just 18 months old, the family moved to Santa Monica in the US, and it was there that Einzig heard that her beloved youngest sister had taken her life at 32 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Julia was the most beautiful soul, the most beautiful person inside and out, but she suffered terribly from <b>mental illness</b> from about the age of 13,” Einzig says quietly. “ She tried so hard and my parents never stopped trying, but her mental ill health was so severe, it was just terrible for her. She had multiple problems, and had multiple treatments, medication, but we lost her – I feel like we lost her from a very young age.” With her husband regularly commuting to London, and her family in <b>Australia</b>, Einzig says she felt adrift in her grief, away from her people, “with no village to turn to”. And so, she went down to the sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When Julia died, I just felt this very strong pull to the ocean, and I think part of that was because that’s where our strongest childhood connections were made, where Julia was part of the gang running around, and where I remember her being happy and free.” At 37 years old, with three children under five, a grieving Einzig bought a wetsuit, found a surf coach and headed for the waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The obsession was immediate, it just got into my bones. After my first surf lesson, I fell hard. I went out after preschool drop off, on weekends, whenever I could, no matter the conditions, it was so hard, but so exhilarating – and with three boys, it was also the only place I got to be alone,” she laughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Santa Monica’s famous Bay Street break, Einzig, who “mostly was just trying to survive out there and not hurt anybody else”, was welcomed by a community of older surfers in their 60s and 70s who gave her surfing tips and schooled her in salty banter. As Einzig improved, she began to travel further in her search for waves, and while the Bay Street line up was mostly men, her travels took her to breaks where women were carving it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I started seeing women on longboards, so elegant and graceful; I started seeing communities of women in their 30s and 40s, and this wasn’t something I was seeing at all in all the books I had on surfing, or in any of the movies I watched. That was all men ripping up these massive waves, but I saw these women out there being fierce and feminine, and it was astounding to me. But this experience of surfing I was seeing was not being represented. I thought “why isn’t there a beautiful coffee-table book on these lovely elegant women?” So Einzig did what women have always done when something is required – she did it herself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Australia</b>. Japan. The United States. The United Kingdom. France. The Philippines. Portugal. From New York to Cornwall, from Biarritz to Byron Bay, Einzig’s book is filled with women surfers who she groups in chapters called The Groundbreakers, The Radical Environmentalists, The Champions, The Culture Shapers and The Devoted. The youngest is 13 (Coolangatta’s Sierra Kerr), the oldest is in her 70s (Joyce Hoffman, San Juan Capistrano, US), and all of them have a story to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I began, I was diving deep into the culture of female surfers, this global network of them, this amazing worldwide community. I found them through following them on <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>, or making connections through people who knew them,” Einzig says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were so many wonderful women, it was really hard to narrow them down, so I was looking for women with fascinating life stories, women who were driven by social impact, women who wanted to lift up others. Then I had to track them down by asking 500 favours, sliding into people’s DMs (direct messages). It was just hours and hours of research, but I had a strong desire to do it. I found all these wonderful women and was offered a book deal in 2020, and then the world blew up with <b>Covid</b>.” The <b>pandemic</b> meant some hasty changes to Einzig’s ambitious, global interviewing and shooting schedule as borders closed and <b>quarantine</b> rules set in. “In the end, I had nine female photographers all over the world – I was determined they had to be female – but I did manage to get to <b>Australia</b> and tell the story of five wonderful surfers there.” <b>Australia</b>’s Gilmore sisters – world champion Stephanie and her older sister Whitney – are featured in the book, along with the remarkable story of their 2019 campaign for equal pay for men and women competing in the World Surfing League (WSL).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I found one of the best things about Stephanie’s story was actually her older sister Whitney’s story, because Whitney has been Steph’s manager since Whitney was 22, and she is just fierce and instinctive about promoting and protecting Stephanie’s brand. She had to negotiate fairer and better contracts for her sister in what was then a very male-dominated culture. She was in there saying to these men who were offering less ‘no, absolutely not, you pay her what she’s worth, this is a four-time world titleholder’. I just loved their relationship.” Then there’s Rockaway Beach’s Natalie J. Greenhill, a trauma surgeon and woman of colour, who paddles out to the man-made Rockaway break in Queens after pulling all- nighters at a New York hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She is such a remarkable woman,” Einzig says. “She considers the ocean her church, the place she goes to find peace after the very real traumas of her job. She is part of a collective that raises funds and mentors local kids to get into surfing, to buy them wetsuits and boards. She has a real understanding of how surfing can help, and heal.” So, too, does Einzig, who began surfing as part of a quest to connect with her sister, who she says she speaks to every time she hits the waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I talk to Julia each time I’m in the ocean, and I do feel her with me. When I’m on the board, we have a little chat and I ask her to help me out on the wave front,” Einzig says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a book filled with remarkable women, its opening dedication is to another one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For Julia”, it reads, “send one for me, Jules. Just for me.” Women Making Waves by Lara Einzig: Penguin, $55</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author of 1984, George Orwell, proving how insightful and pres­cient he was, argues “some ideas are so stupid, only intellectuals believe in them”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The floods and overflowing dams around Sydney prove the climate ­activist Tim Flannery must have been in la-la land when arguing global warming would inevitably lead to droughts and empty dams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever-increasing energy prices and the dangers of blackouts caused by ­closing power stations sourced by coal and gas and relying on unreliable and intermittent wind and solar power is another example of alarmist academics getting it wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the scientific advice given by supposed experts like Flannery, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews ­justifies banning searching for on-shore gas at the same time as making coal-powered stations uneconomical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radical gender activists in our universities telling primary school children boys can be girls and girls can be boys, as gender and sexuality are social constructs instead of being biologically ­determined, is yet another example ­illustrating how supposedly intelligent academics deny reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A podcast released by Sydney’s Festival of Dangerous Ideas featuring a Professor from <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, Dr Matthew Liao, and his solution to global warming proves, yet again, how many academics must be living in an alternate universe. Dr Liao’s presentation argues urgent and immediate ­action must be taken as “it is too late to prevent human-induced climate change” and too risky to employ “mitigation through techniques of geo-­engineering like giant space mirrors or seeding the oceans with iron to prompt carbon-absorbing algal blooms”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, given the urgency of the problem, Dr Liao suggests a ground-breaking solution guaranteed to solve the problem of humans infecting the Gaia and causing such destruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Liao suggests: “So, why not ­address the source of the problem and engineer humans to reduce our environmental impact and adapt? Genetic engineering could make us smaller or reduce our appetite for meat. Doses of Oxytocin could make us more sympathetic and co-operative. Such possibilities are criticised as extreme but are they more so than re-engineering the planet?” Much like Jonathan Swift’s ­fictitious Academy Of Lagado, where scientists work to extract sunlight out of cucumbers and turn human excrement back into food, Dr Liao’s idea to reduce the carbon footprint by employing genetic engineering and drugs to make people smaller and easy to control ­appears laughable and beyond reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, given the strategies addressing climate change and the global <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> recommended by bodies like the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span> and the <span class="companylink">World Health Organisation</span>, it’s wrong to dismiss Dr Liao’s idea as unrealistic and implausible.  Across the globe, there are more and more examples of governments embarking on mad crazy ideas to reduce carbon emissions, improve the environment and save citizens from <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> and its variants based on so-called reputable and rational scientific advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>New Zealand</b> Government, even though the county’s contribution to global emissions is only 0.17 per cent compared to China’s 30 per cent and America’s 14 per cent, plans to tax cows and sheep burping and thus penalise one of <b>New Zealand</b>’s most important agricultural industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the reasons Sri Lanka is now an economic basket case and where there are food riots is because the government, on the advice of scientific experts, banned synthetic fertilisers and pesticides and made farmers go organic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic rice production fell 20 per cent in months and now rice has to be imported at great cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmers in the Netherlands, who recently blockaded roads with hundreds of tractors as a protest, are facing similar pressures by government to reduce fertilisers and cut back on livestock based on dodgy scientific advice arguing, unless immediate action is taken, the world is facing a climate apocalypse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar to the issue of how best to ­respond to global warming, the emergence of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> virus also illustrates the dangers of governments overreacting and adopting dangerous and irrational policies based on hasty and unproven scientific advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of draconian lockdowns and border closures across <b>Australia</b>, millions have suffered <b>mental illness</b>, ill health and financial ruin. Students have lost months of learning, setting back standards by years and the promise ­experimental vaccines would provide immunity has been proven illusory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse still, the World Health Org­anisation is campaigning to mandate a global <b>Pandemic</b> Treaty giving it the power to enforce lockdowns, mandatory jobs and digital health IDs designed to monitor citizens’ movements. Dr Kevin Donnelly is a senior fellow at the ACU’s PM Glynn Institute.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUSIC JAMES BAY LOVES BEING BACK ON TOUR AND LOVES BEING HOME WITH HIS BABY A week after English singer songwriter James Bay dropped his new single Give Me the Reason, his name was flooding social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were plenty of posts congratulating him on his epic rock anthem, yet the majority were linked to Harry Styles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics and fans pointed to similarities between the fresh Styles’ track As It Was, released in April, and Pink Lemonade, the 2018 single from Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an era when a single tweet drawing comparisons between two songs can spark legal action, nice guy singer songwriter Bay took the high road of being graciously flattered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first time I heard (As It Was), I really liked it. Then a few mates started texting me asking if I’d been on social media and had a look at all the Harry Styles fans saying, ‘All right, Harry, I see you’ve been listening to a bit of James Bay’s second album, have you?’” a grinning Bay says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It made me laugh. It’s all very flattering and I think he’s great and there may be similarities between his song and (Pink Lemonade) but there are similarities between my song and 100 other songs before it.” It’s impossible not to hear the influence of Bay’s musical heroes in the songs of his third record Leap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s his take on the stadium-sized rock anthems of his heroes like the Rolling Stones, The Band, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and U2, and their progeny The Killers and Kings Of Leon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He may be a solo singer-songwriter, erroneously labelled folk when he’s always tilted more towards a bigger rock sound, but Bay just loves guitar bands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a solo artist, I am trying to come with that kind of energy in my own way, with that kind of anthemic experience. Hence why (new songs) like Give Me the Reason, Everybody Needs Someone and Endless Summer Nights get written,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bay cites Nick Cave when trying to describe the genesis of Leap. Bay was struggling as he began the album’s songwriting sessions in Nashville in 2019. The artist, who burst on to the global charts in 2014 with Let It Go and Hold Back the River, was battling anxiety, insecurity, impostor syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he wrote One Life, a song inspired by his wife Lucy; the pair have been partners since they were 16 and welcomed their baby girl Ada in October last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A friend told me Nick Cave had this quote about when we’re sad, we write towards happiness, and when we’re happy, we write towards sadness, and it’s absolutely bang on the money,” Bay says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You try to hide the stark truth and say ‘No, no, I’m OK’. And through that struggle, dealing with anxiety and insecurity, I surprised myself, especially once I’d written One Life, and that was when I started to write towards happiness.” Bay acknowledges he will face his <b>mental health</b> challenges again because songwriters and performers are on a relentless rollercoaster ride of the highest highs and lowest lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He declares therapy to be a “beautiful, brilliant mechanism”, particularly when combined with the catharsis of turning life’s anguish into song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for now, with a new record about to launch and the joys and terrors of new parenthood, life is good even as he wrestles with the family versus touring dilemma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ada’s nine months old now … she’s just so great … and I have to tell you all the cliches are true,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I go away now, it’s bittersweet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have this beautiful baby, this wonderful life at home with this gorgeous family and I get to go on tour and do the thing that I adore doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We got back on a tour bus in April and May for the first time in however many years with a band and it was glorious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s such a mix of emotions when you have a great night, hop off stage into the bus for a post-match drink and then wake up in the morning ready to do it all again, and then I look at a picture of my baby and think ‘I do want to go home’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s ridiculous but ultimately, I do feel very fortunate.” Like most of his peers, Bay spent months imagining what the return to live would look like and, more importantly, how it would feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I remember texting with Maggie Rogers during the <b>pandemic</b> and saying the first time when everybody gets back to this, it’s going to be remarkable. It’s going to be euphoric. And it’s just going to be tears, the best tears ever, but a room full of thousands and thousands of tears,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My first show back I was solo – they didn’t want too many people on stage – and it was in a forest; it was the most Robin Hood thing ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was magical, it was summertime and dappled light was coming through the trees and it was intensely emotional, the tears were many, which I had to try to hold back because I was trying to sing songs.” Leap is out now. James Bay will tour <b>Australia</b> in 2023</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Volvos to ABBA and flat-pack furniture, <b>Australia</b> has had a love affair with Swedish imports, and now <b>Australia</b>’s biggest private hospital group is adopting a Scandinavian model to improve our <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        <span class="companylink">Ramsay Health Care</span>, a $16bn ASX-listed health giant, has begun moving its <b>mental health</b> services outside hospitals and into the community, opening 11 psychology clinics across <b>Australia</b>, with plans to establish 20 more in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a model Ramsay has adopted across its Swedish operations, and comes as demand for <b>mental health</b> services is soaring during the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 200 psychologists running Ramsay’s Australian clinics have completed about 10,000 consultations in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The community clinics have helped keep Ramsay’s 1100 <b>mental health</b> hospital beds for those who are acutely unwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramsay hopes it can partner with state governments to ease chronic shortages across the ­public system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ramsay <b>Australia</b> chief executive Carmel Monaghan said a lack of uniformity in the funding of out-of-hospital care by health insurers was limiting access to the clinics. “Unfortunately, health insurers are not uniform in their funding of community and at-home services, leaving whole states or geographical regions without this option. This means that the clinician and patient choices for care setting is limiting,” Ms Monaghan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In addition to this, some insurers dictate clinical program frequency, duration and type that are not necessarily evidence-based. Psychiatric or <b>mental health</b> care is usually only in the highest insurance categories, which can also be limiting for many people.” Ramsay and British health insurer <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> are embroiled in a funding dispute that remains unresolved despite their existing contract expiring on August 2. <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> customers will have to pay potentially higher out-of-pocket fees if the pair fail to strike a new funding agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, <span class="companylink">Bupa</span> and Ramsay – which the late Paul Ramsay founded in 1964 when he opened a psychiatric hospital on Sydney’s north shore – share some common ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Bupa</span>’s global chief executive Inaki Ereno told The Australian last month that <b>Australia</b> needed to adapt to more flexible models of healthcare – such as recuperating in homes rather than hospitals – to ward off a looming health crisis that threatens to drain the federal budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Ereno said <b>Australia</b> could benefit from was the so-called campus model that directed patients to day surgeries, at-home rehabilitation or whatever place suited their needs, “as opposed to just everyone going to an acute hospital and then waiting their turn”. And Ms Monaghan said the <b>mental health</b> clinics were part of ensuring that Ramsay treated patients “in the right environment, with the right care at the right place at the right times, depending on what that need is”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With (Ramsay’s) strong background and experience and given the growing need for <b>mental health</b> care accelerated by <b>Covid</b>, we saw a need to extend our <b>mental health</b> service provision beyond the hospital walls and into the community,” Ms Monaghan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Taking our expertise into the community allows an individual with a <b>mental health</b> need to access help before their situation escalates and reduces the risk of an inpatient admission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are lots of opportunities, like we have in Sweden where we run psychology and community-based <b>mental health</b> services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can offer the broader range and you can look after populations more effectively and scale those models of care. That’s where we think the future lies.” The community clinics offer more than counselling services, providing treatment for all <b>mental health</b> concerns including those associated with mood, anxiety and substance misuse, eating disorders and PTSD as well as psychometric testing for cognitive impairment, attention deficit disorder and other behavioural problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It comes after Ramsay, which is subject to a $20bn takeover from <span class="companylink">KKR</span>, launched a $3m public-private partnership with the NSW government to provide more <b>mental health</b> services to adolescents and young adults late last year. That initiative involved six new inpatient beds provided by Ramsay <b>Mental Health</b> at Northside Group Macarthur Clinic, Campbelltown to treat young people aged 14-24 for a range of <b>mental health</b> disorders.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff exodus sees doors shut, kids turned away AN under the radar staffing crisis has hit NSW preschools, with a lack of teachers forcing some centres to close their doors and turn families away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 3200 early childhood educator roles are vacant across the state according to online listings, with one ­national provider confirming 10 per cent of its workforce was missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And union data ­reveals over a third of preschool teachers planned to leave the profession soon, with low pay and excessive workloads the main reasons for the exodus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Educational leader at Lane Cove’s Birrahlee Preschool, Tash Smith, said the situation had worsened in the past ­couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve had to completely close some of our eight classrooms a handful of times ­because we just didn’t have any staff and the casual pool was dry,” Ms Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve had to send emails to parents and say: ‘Sorry, we’re closed this week, don’t come in’, which is unheard of.” Ms Smith said educators were fatigued and feeling ­undervalued, and <b>Covid</b> and the flu was also taking its toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Strain and exhaustion is resulting in staff <b>mental health</b> days which we’ve never seen before,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodstart Early Learning Carlton teacher Sonia Mc­Leod, said the crisis was being felt across the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s a combination of things like pay and con­ditions, ­people falling sick and <b>Covid</b> causing delays in training that have all hit at the same time,” Ms McLeod said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the teacher shortage plaguing primary and high schools, early learning centres don’t have the option to leave children unsupervised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, about 15 per cent of the state’s centres have been issued a temporary waiver, ­exempting them from the usual child to carer ratios set by national regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Teachers are working 10 hours a day, they don’t even get 30 minutes for lunch, and they don’t get school holidays off because they’re working in vacation care,” <span class="companylink">Independent Education Union of <b>Australia</b></span> early childhood services org­aniser Kate Damo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another union, the United Workers Union, found 37 per cent of early childhood ­educators did not plan to stay in the industry long term, and 26 per cent planned to quit within 12 months. The NSW government hopes a $281.6 million boost to the sector could be the solution.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ELITE netballers have embraced a bold $6.5 million plan to take over Super Netball which promises to deliver better <b>mental health</b> support and give players a seat at the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netball <b>Australia</b> Players’ Association president Jo Weston said players had felt ignored for several years and to have an investor willing to not only back the sport but give the athletes a say in how the game was run was “exciting”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Mental health</b> support and being heard are the two demands players have felt <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> has ignored for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now with a private investor, bankrolled by a tier 1 global investment company with former Diamond Liz Ellis on the board, the players are keen to see where the new group could take the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tier 1 global put forward their proposal, to buy out the sport’s debt and take over the Super Netball league, to <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> responded by calling an emergency meeting with SSN CEOs. Matt Berriman, the chair of <b>Mental Health Australia</b>, entrepreneur and avid netball fan, has taken the lead on the bid – which he didn’t submit until consulting with the players’ association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A step <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> has been heavily criticised for skipping in the past – most recently with the decision to sell the grand final to the Western Australian government in a bid to recover some of their $4.5 million debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vixens star Weston (above) said it was an exciting proposal was glad players were part of the discussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> went public with their financial position a couple of weeks ago and for a large amount of our playing group that was quite a scary situation to read,” Weston said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It really makes you question the stability of the competition and what the future could have looked like, so for someone to be investing in the competition is a really exciting prospect for our playing group.” Berriman’s proposal includes $4.5 million to <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> for the Super Netball competition plus an additional two $1 million payments over two years to be invested in grassroots and the Diamonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equity group also have a “significant amount” more to invest directly into the Super Netball and cover running costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of that includes a plan to increase the support available to players, particularly for their <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey conducted by NewsCorp earlier this year found 72 per cent of players didn’t think <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> was doing enough to protect their <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weston said the playing group had been advocating for more support for several years, particularly since the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> CEO Kelly Ryan responded to the bid on Friday telling NewsCorp it was not the only proposal they had received and it would be considered following the review of the Super Netball competition while Netball Queensland CEO Kate Davies was not surprised by the interest. “This is the best netball competition in the world so it’s not surprising it has attracted this type of attention. This comes at a time when the NA is completing a State of the Game review into the SSN,” Davies said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE TWO LEADS OF THIS GLITTERING MUSICAL TALK ABOUT THEIR EXCITEMENT WITH LISA MAYOH You can colour Paulini Curuenvauli and Euan Fistrovic Doidge happy – because they are starring in Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical opens at the Capitol Theatre next year after a season in Melbourne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the former Australian idol star Paulini, starring in the show will be bittersweet. The almost 40-year-old is still grieving the death of her father and musical influence Isireli in 2020 and says playing the narrator in the upcoming show would have meant a lot to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This will be the second time I’m a leading lady so it’s surreal for me,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I actually still can’t believe I got the job because I was doing another show at the time and I didn’t know whether to audition, to the point where I actually missed the first set of auditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I walked in and they were just so encouraging. I was so nervous because I had gotten some of the music just a week before, but I gave it a go and did my best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m just thankful to be working – and to be getting a leading role like this with an amazing production team is massive – it’s really an honour.” Paulini worked with Fistrovic Doidge on Saturday Night Fever. As the narrator in Joseph, Paulini will sing the whole show from centre stage. While she still gets nervous speaking in front of crowds, singing she can do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m one of those people that if I walk into a room and see a familiar face, I’m already in a good mood – I’m like, okay, I can do this,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just need that one face.” In late 2020, Paulini released Twenty Twenty while continuing to work on new music and more recently appeared on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, where fans fell in love with her all over again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she says she can’t wait to get back on stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s so great to see the arts and the music industry come alive again,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I love performing live, so when that wasn’t happening for me, it was quite depressing and it was quite a challenge.” Paulini lives in Sydney and cares for her mother, who has health issues. She will relocate to Melbourne where the show will open in November before returning to Sydney in February. Despite the challenges of the <b>pandemic</b>, she used the time to immerse herself in writing and recording new music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m not going to downplay it, it was a hard time for us and so many. “It actually gave me a lot of time to think about those things and to really process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Because while <b>Covid</b> was happening, my father passed away, which was such a hard time and I loved that I could take time out to heal from that mentally, spiritually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Physically I’ve always been quite OK, I love going for runs and going to the gym but all the other stuff was getting put on hold, which is, which was the most important thing I think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s one thing I realised throughout the <b>Covid</b> period, your <b>mental health</b> is something that you always have to put first.” The youngest of six from a traditional Fijian family, she says meditation and prayer helped her heal. Hanging on to fond childhood memories of singing in church, where her father was choir master, she was reminded that music was in her blood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s how I grew up, I basically learned how to sing in church,” she said. “I’ve never really had any training in acting or singing or dance. That singing in church, the harmonies … it’s such a euphoric feeling when you hear that type of music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s a freedom in that that I don’t think you can really find in secular music and the commercial world because you’re connecting to something higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My dad was such a huge part of me musically, learning how to sing, so I do miss him in a lot of things that I’m kind of doing now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People know the show so well, but it’s been 30 years since this production was in <b>Australia</b>, and some incredible people have played this role. So, for me, getting a chance to do something as big as this and showing representation for the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People Of Colour) community of playing a role such as Joseph, it’s honestly a dream. I feel incredibly blessed and a little overwhelmed, but in the best way possible.” Married life, he says, topped off the year that just keeps getting better. He will approach the role of Joseph with a “fresh, open mind”, not wanting to adapt too much of productions past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And it’s a show that’s completely sung through and I haven’t done a show like that since Les Mis which is going back, so I’m sure it’s going to be challenging, but in the best way possible,” he says. “Every show I’ve done is special in their own way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve never thought of anything else I’d be doing because I’ve always known. “Ever since I started dancing people would say: ‘What do you want to do?’ And I would say: ‘I’m going to be musical theatre’ and I just made it happen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NETBALL ELITE netballers have embraced a bold $6.5 million plan to takeover Super Netball that promises to deliver better <b>mental health</b> support and give players a louder voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netball <b>Australia</b> Players’ Association president Jo Weston said players had felt ignored for several years and to have an investor willing to not only back the sport but give the athletes a say in how the game was run was “exciting”.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tier 1 global put forward their proposal, to buy out the sport’s debt and takeover the Super Netball league, to <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> on Friday. <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> responded by calling an emergency meeting with SSN CEOs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A step <span class="companylink">Netball <b>Australia</b></span> has been heavily criticised for skipping in the past – most recently with the decision to sell the grand final to the Western Australian government in a bid to recover some of their $4.5 million debt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An under-the-radar staffing crisis has hit NSW preschools, with a lack of teachers forcing some centres to close their doors and turn families away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 3200 early childhood educator roles are vacant across the state according to online listings, with one national provider confirming 10 per cent of its workforce was missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It comes as union data revealed more than a third of preschool teachers planned to leave the profession soon, with low pay and excessive workloads the main reasons for the exodus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Educational leader at Lane Cove’s Birrahlee Preschool Tash Smith said the situation had worsened in the past couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve had to completely close some of our eight classrooms a handful of times because we just didn’t have any staff and the casual pool was dry,” Ms Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve had to send emails to parents and say: ‘Sorry, we’re closed this week, don’t come in’, which is unheard of.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Smith said educators were fatigued and feeling undervalued, and <b>Covid</b> and the flu were also taking their toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Strain and exhaustion is resulting in staff <b>mental health</b> days, which we’ve never seen before,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teacher at Goodstart Early Learning Carlton, Sonia McLeod, said the crisis was being felt right across the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s a combination of things like pay and conditions, people falling sick and <b>Covid</b> causing delays in training that have all hit at the same time,” Ms McLeod said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the teacher shortage plaguing primary and high schools, early learning centres don’t have the option to leave children unsupervised. However, about 15 per cent of the state’s centres have been issued a temporary waiver, exempting them from the usual child-to-carer ratios set by national regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preschool teacher exodus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re dealing with a situation where teachers are working 10 hours a day, they don’t even get 30 minutes for lunch, and they don’t get school holidays off because they’re working in vacation care,” independent Education Union of <b>Australia</b> early childhood services organiser Kate Damo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data collected by another union representing preschool teachers, the United Workers Union, last year revealed 37 per cent of early childhood educators did not plan to stay in the industry long term, and 26 per cent planned to quit within 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those not planning to leave, 46 per cent still thought about quitting “all or most of the time”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United Workers early education executive director Helen Gibbons said last year’s data was becoming reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re leaving in droves and those that are staying have really poor morale, and the workload is now worse because their colleagues are gone,” Ms Gibbons said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Perrottet government hopes a $281.6 million boost to the sector could be the solution, investing in 18,000 new childcare jobs in the most recent state budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have had many conversations with early childhood teachers and educators, peak bodies, service directors, and stakeholders about the need to invest in our early childhood education and care workforce,” Early Learning Minister Sarah Mitchell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daily Telegraph – News Feed latest episode</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodstart Early Learning head of advocacy John Cherry said he looked forward to seeing the plan in greater detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our vacancy rates have gone up exponentially, with one in 10 permanent roles unfilled, and that’s higher in NSW than other states,” Mr Cherry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have an immediate crisis that’s going to get worse next year when new childcare subsidies take effect, then again when the state rolls out its pre-kindergarten plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We pay 4 per cent above the award wage but we can’t pay more unless we charge families more, which they can’t afford, so we really need government investment.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She created an app intended as a safe space for women. Little did Sall Grover know it would land her in the middle of a heated discrimination battle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The warm Gold Coast sun is beaming on soonto-be mum Sall Grover but there’s nothing sunny about her mood this morning. As she talks about the upcoming legal challenge to her business, a female-only social networking platform, she struggles to contain her rage. In the final weeks of her pregnancy she should be nesting and preparing for the birth; instead she’s gearing up for a battle that will have far-reaching implications not only for her, she believes, but for all women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all seemed so simple when she established the free app Giggle in 2019 as a female-only space where women can chat about issues, promote their business, find accommodation, network and share their intimate thoughts with like-minded users. The 37-year-old grew up on the Gold Coast, studying film, journalism and philosophy at <span class="companylink">Bond University</span> before leaving <b>Australia</b> to fulfil her dream of being a romcom screenwriter in Hollywood. A decade later, after witnessing first-hand misogyny and sexual abuse towards women in Hollywood, she returned home and created the app as a means of therapy for herself and others. Anticipating that some men might try to crash the platform, she took steps to ensure that it could only be accessed by women. “When they [men] decide to really go after us, which they do every few weeks or months, they do it by the high thousands in a short period of time.” So to access Giggle, new members are required to upload a photograph to be verified through facial recognition software to confirm they are female. Grover says it is about 94 per cent accurate and women rarely run into problems; if they do it is often only due to a blurry or highly pixelated image. “If Giggle didn’t have gatekeeping to create a female-only platform, it wouldn’t be one. It’s as simple as that. An onboarding selfie is the easiest, most effective way to do this,” she says. The platform soon grew and now connects 20,000 women in 88 countries. “We have women in countries like Saudi Arabia or Orthodox Jewish women where female-only spaces are incredibly important. We have women who are recovering and dealing with trauma, and the space has significance to them in their healing,” she explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just weeks after going live in the testing phase, Giggle found itself dealing with the first online attack. The security settings weren’t in full effect and some new users left reviews accusing it of being transphobic. Grover was shocked; she never imagined her efforts to create a safe space for women would land her at the centre of a gender war and see her taken to the Federal Court for discrimination, labelled a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and receive death threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been hell,” she says. “It’s terrifying and I’ve had to navigate it all through nine months of pregnancy. I created a social network for women, myself included, where we can relax on the internet away from death threats and toxic male behaviour.” While always outspoken about women’s rights, she never considered herself an activist. And she still doesn’t.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grover says that during the app development phase it was envisaged that transwomen would be able to contact Giggle if they wished to join, “because honestly we thought we’d be dealing with a minuscule amount of people in this context”. However, following the early attacks, this idea was dropped. Worried that some men were claiming to be women to gain access, “we changed the Giggle policy to strictly female-only out of necessity”. But by then, the negative comments had stuck. “We did ad testing on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>, and they got banned for hateful content. <span class="companylink">Google</span> ads take our reviews into account and because we’ve been attacked our ads would be pushed to the bottom of the pile,” she explains. “We wanted to do equity crowd funding, which would allow women to have ownership in a start-up and have investment in the financial world. No equity crowd funding company would work with us, saying the trans issue was like an open wound.” Despite these setbacks, Grover remained steadfast that the app should be solely for biological women. So, in September last year, when manually checking the screening process, she saw a photo of a person she took to be a man who’d got through the screening and removed the profile. “I thought nothing of it because we’d removed men before and since,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realising she’d been removed, this person, Roxanne Tickle, emailed Giggle to confirm she was a transgender woman. Grover didn’t reply to the email; she says it’s impossible to respond to every email. The following month she says she received a text on her personal phone from Tickle, saying she wanted to talk about joining Giggle. “I froze. No other user had ever contacted me on my phone,” she recalls. Then on January 20 this year Grover received a discrimination complaint made to the <span class="companylink">Australian Human Rights Commission</span> by Tickle. The following day Tickle tweeted that she would be incurring quite a few expenses for her advocacy work this year and needed funding. On her Ko-fi page (a platform for collecting donations) she says: “I spend a lot of my ‘spare’ time and expend a lot of emotional energy drawing attention to our (already!) legally protected rights and helping cis people at least try to understand what it means to be trans.” In her complaint Tickle stated she believed she was being discriminated against by Giggle because she is a transgender woman. “The app provider appears to not recognise transgender women as female. I am legally permitted to identify as female.” Tickle called upon Giggle management to undergo education on sex, gender and gender identity and she wanted full access to the app for herself and other people identifying as female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grover refused to give ground. She says that, based on what Tickle was and still is seeking, conciliation would have resulted in her business and the space she’s created for women around the world being destroyed. “Roxanne wants all males identifying as women to be allowed on, and any offensive comments to transwomen made on the app moderated,” she says. “And for me to go to sex and gender education. I am educated on sex and gender; I just don’t agree with their ideology. I am never going to agree with those things. It renders my company useless and takes away my own human rights.” Unable to reach conciliation, Tickle took the matter to the Federal Court alleging unlawful discrimination under the <span class="companylink">Australian Human Rights Commission</span> Act 1986. When she was served the papers, a heavily pregnant Grover says she burst into tears. “I felt shattered. My first thought was, the first year or two of my daughter’s life will be spent doing all of this,” she says. “I feel like I’m in in the midst of a nervous breakdown, like I’m under surveillance. When we created the app we did not think we’d be fighting something like this that could be a landmark legislative case for <b>Australia</b>.” Tickle, 53, from Lismore, issued a statement saying that “as there is a legal process unfolding, I would prefer not to comment at this stage”. In the court documents Tickle said that although her sex at birth was male, she has had her birth certificate reissued to say she is a female and a letter from her physician confirming her gender is female. She is claiming discrimination in relation to comments from Grover “that she considered transgender women, including the applicant, to be male” and is seeking damages, an apology and full access to the app. “I believe Giggle and Sall Grover have decided in error that I am male and have declined to grant me full access to the app.” Christine Quinan, a lecturer in Gender Studies at the <span class="companylink">University of Melbourne</span>, says the issue of allowing transwomen into women’s spaces is charged and contentious. Quinan believes the Automatic Gender Recognition technology used by Giggle relies on an outmoded understanding of gender and reinforces marginalisation of trans people, preventing them from fully participating in society. “We cannot underestimate the impacts on health and wellbeing when trans and gender diverse people are continually asked to prove their legitimacy and to prove their very existence,” they said. “While biometrics and statistical surveillance supposedly provide proof that we are who we say we are, that burden of proof is unduly placed on those who do not ‘match’ expected norms, facilitating exclusionary, rather than inclusionary goals.” Equality <b>Australia</b> CEO Anna Brown says discrimination laws exist to ensure everyone has equal access to participate in public life on equal terms. “Women who are trans experience extraordinary rates of abuse, sexual assault and discrimination – often at the hands of men,” Brown says. “The resulting social <b>isolation</b> drives some of the worst <b>mental health</b> outcomes in the community, with research revealing that almost one in two transgender people have attempted suicide.” She says service owners and providers including online platforms and apps have the responsibility to ensure people can access their service without discrimination. “Products marketed for women must be inclusive of all women.” Having experienced exclusion and discrimination first-hand, Tasmanian trans advocate Martine Delaney has spent 20 years fighting for trans rights and legislative reform. She feels trans people are being sent a clear message they are not welcome and are being denied access to crucial parts of life, including the ability to connect. “Giggle seems to be saying you are not welcome because our view is you don’t belong in this community despite what the law may say,” Delaney explains. “It is saying we are going to put a chromosome line in the sand, and it doesn’t matter who you are as an individual and how you conduct yourself, but if you are trans you are not welcome here. So, it cannot be anything but discriminatory. It’s a damaging message for people to get and the trans community is probably one of the most marginalised people already. It assumes all transwomen are unsafe. It assumes all cis women are safe.” Delaney believes Giggle should have a system that allows transwomen access but not males and that if the inclusion of transwomen on the app offends some women, then they have the ability to remove themselves. While she praised Tickle for bringing the action, she said she had “mixed feelings” about the court case. “In the current climate, it gives more ammunition to exclude trans people,” she says. “It is not helped by trans activists giving Sall a hard time. Attacking is not of any real value.” Grover’s lawyer Anna Kerr, principal solicitor at the Feminist Legal Clinic, contends the case goes to the heart of defining what is a woman and that the implications will be far-reaching. Kerr says the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act 1984 allows for “special measures” to advance women’s substantive equality and provides for the exclusion of males where it is reasonable in all circumstances. However, state-based laws, which she says conflate the concepts of biological sex and socially constructed gender identity, enable males to claim to be “legally female” and thereby render these Commonwealth provisions effectively inoperable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This case will be the first to examine whether state laws that allow for change of sex are inconsistent with the operation of Commonwealth laws designed to advance affirmatively women’s substantive equality,” says Kerr. “If found to be inconsistent with Commonwealth laws, this would render state laws allowing for change of sex on birth certificates and official documents invalid under section 109 of the Australian Constitution.” She says the case will also examine how the 2013 amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act adding gender identity as a protected attribute should be interpreted to avoid internal inconsistencies that arise if males who have a trans identity are required to be recognised as women in all contexts. “If sex and gender/gender identity are to be protected as distinct attributes, they must be clearly defined at law,” she says. “Laws in all Australian jurisdictions that purport to protect the rights of women and girls as a sex class must now unequivocally distinguish sex from gender/ gender identity.” Kara Dansky is a US lawyer, women’s rights campaigner and author of the book The Abolition of Sex: How the ‘Transgender’ Agenda Harms Women and Girls. Like Kerr, Dansky fears women are on the brink of losing hard-fought rights and that <b>Australia</b> is moving down the US path. “The Biden administration has redefined the word sex to include gender identity throughout US Federal administrative law,” Dansky says. “All of Biden’s orders on this topic are currently subject to federal litigation. Nonetheless US Federal agencies are proceeding to annihilate women’s rights at the altar of gender identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It ought to be universally understood that women ought to have rights to our opinion and assembly without men,” she adds. She believes Giggle is an important virtual space for women and if Grover were to lose the case it would be a backward step for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grover has been bolstered by the support and insists she and Giggle are not anti transgender. (Giggle does allow trans men – women who identify as men – on the platform.) “I don’t care if you want to identify as a woman and live your life that way, I only care if you want to come into a female space,” she says. “I am not a gender feminist. I want no labels. I am just a woman.” Grover says she is now regularly trolled online. “For the most part I don’t take it personally anymore, although there are some days that are harder than others. The trolling of women online by men is why we started a social network where that is not possible. We created this app for women, and I have spent two and half years, every day having to think about men.” Now embroiled in a court case, how far is Grover prepared to take it? “We will go as far as we have to go. We have to go with what is right. “Having found out that I’m going to have a daughter during this whole process has only made the fight more personal,” she adds. “It’s my job to protect her and part of that is protecting her rights. I won’t stop fighting until I know for sure that she can go to a change room or Girl Guides or use a female-only app and know it is truly for females.”</p>

                           Boris Johnson is a ‘tour de force’ if not a model citizen</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        Boris Johnson is headed out as British prime minister and for now nobody knows who’s coming in (“Bloodied Boris finally breaks”, 8/7). That there is no obvious successor suggests there is a dearth of talent in the ranks; that Johnson is a bon vivant among meat and spuds, a tour de force amid a pack of drones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn’t enough for them that he breached the Labour “red wall” in 2019, that he has seen the country through the greatest crisis since World War II or that he kept his promise to deliver Britain from the EU. They wanted a model citizen as well and Johnson is not that person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the dust settles he will form part of a triumvirate of post-war Conservative prime ministers who, by the force of their personalities, have left an indelible stamp on Britain. Churchill delivered it from the threat of tyranny, Thatcher from the yoke of socialism and Johnson from the bureaucratic morass of the EU.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Keogh, East Fremantle, WA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’ve lost track of time, but I think I’ve been watching the ABC’s non-stop coverage of Boris’s resignation for about three hours now and I’ve yet to see anyone say anything kind about Boris. There must surely be some people who think kind things about him, as I do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, one frequently repeated news package on the ABC contains the line: “Boris Johnson’s eight-year run as Lord Mayor of London afforded him global notoriety.” Notoriety? As in “famous for some bad quality or deed”? I think not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two things I’m not clear on:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, whether most of the people who objected to Partygate objected 1, because they think Downing Street should have resisted pressure from epidemiologists, virologists and others and let Britain party in similar situations (i.e. parties of young and healthy people, in which case <b>Covid</b> was unlikely to kill participants, and parties of <b>Covid</b>-free people who were disciplined when coming into contact with people outside the bubble), or 2, because they think the strict <b>lockdown</b> should have operated for everyone, absolutely everywhere, including for lone walkers on the Derbyshire moors irrespective of the cost to the economy and to people’s <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m also not clear how serious Chris Pincher’s drunken gropes were and whether the criticisms of Boris shrugging Pincher’s misbehaviour off with “Pincher by name, Pincher by nature” come mostly from homophobes and Labour supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Oliver, Paddington, Qld</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a splendid word, petard, you use in describing a modern-day Shakespearean tragedy, Boris Johnson’s fall from prime ministerial grace (“Boris hoisted by petard of spin”, 8/7). Its definitional origin as a detonator used to breach impregnable fortifications aptly describes Johnson’s impact on British politics. Faced with an apparently impregnable establishment embrace of EU membership, he succeeded in the herculean task of “getting Brexit done”. Yet, as you say, behind a facade of brilliance lurked a hinterland of chaos in Johnson’s personal life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Kidd, Auchenflower, Qld</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Sexton provides food for thought on the real reasons for Boris Johnson’s demise as prime minister (“Boris Johnson's true crime: he delivered on Brexit”, 8/7). Johnson suffered the same fate as two other conservative leaders in the Western world in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnson delivered on Brexit, Donald Trump delivered on his promise to make the US energy-independent, and Scott Morrison steered <b>Australia</b> capably through the <b>Covid pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therein lies an effective strategy that left-wing leaders who thrive on populist appeal now know works well. The best way to bring down a conservative leader is to accuse him or her of being a garrulous populist and feed it to the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Bell, Heidelberg Heights, Vic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Boris Johnson’s stewardship has ended in a circus but he should also be lauded for his achievements in politics; particularly his vision of the bigger picture for liberal democracies. I was in the UK during the 2019 election; UK Labour presented domestic and foreign policy scenarios from another planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnson barnstormed historically Labour constituencies in the north of England (where he was genuinely liked), won a massive majority for the Conservatives, delivered Brexit, led the Europeans in defending Ukraine and understood the Asia-Pacific challenges with his support for AUKUS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Sheridan’s assessment of Johnson that “his rise was as spectacular as his fall” (8/7) sums up his time in politics. Thank goodness for Boris though; the policies of the Marxist Corbynistas would have torched Western achievements and values on an unprecedented scale across the UK (and beyond). He helped to reset UK Labour to a more sensible middle ground through his achievements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Marchant, Pascoe Vale, Vic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UK prime minister did not lose his party’s support because of any establishment or media resentment over his campaign to leave the EU. His demise came about because the Conservatives could no longer endure the sight of his pants catching fire every time their leader opened his mouth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        Jim Chalmers’ first budget will include a new “wellbeing” statement aimed at measuring how Australians are faring in their daily lives to better inform policy development and ensure the ­nation is pursuing the “right kind of growth”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasurer will reveal the inclusion of the statement in the October budget during his address on Friday to the <b>Australia New Zealand</b> Leadership Forum, saying he has a lot to learn from the <b>New Zealand</b> experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Jacinda Ardern’s government unveiled a “wellbeing budget” in 2019 that prioritised new areas including <b>mental health</b>, reducing child poverty, Maori aspiration, the digital economy and the transition to a low-­emissions future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Chalmers said he would seek discussions with his <b>New Zealand</b> counterpart Grant Robertson on how <b>Australia</b> could pursue a similar goal, arguing that his objective was to “ensure growth is broad and inclusive”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wellbeing commitment from Dr Chalmers comes as he faces a series of pressing challenges, including how to respond to an acute cost-of-living crisis, spiralling energy prices, spiking inflation and an aggressive rate-hike cycle being pursued by the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an advance copy of his speech, Dr Chalmers said Australians should judge policies “against agreed markers of progress … That begins with measuring what matters – not instead of traditional economic indicators but in addition to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At a time of record debt and budget pressures and cost-of-­living pressures, value for money is essential and we judge it by what it means for the right kind of growth, including sustainable incomes growth. We have a lot to learn from the experience of <b>New Zealand</b> friends and I’m looking forward to talking about this again with Grant (Robertson).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“His wellbeing approach has significantly reshaped the conversation in <b>New Zealand</b> about the budget and the economy. I want <b>Australia</b> to have a similar conversation about how we can better improve policy design, evaluation and priority setting.” Speaking on Thursday, Dr Chalmers said both <b>New Zealand</b> and <b>Australia</b> were navigating “some of the most challenging global circumstances in our memory” from the rise in global inflation and rising interest rates to the war in Ukraine “all while the <b>pandemic</b> still lingers and global supply chains remained strained”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said families were feeling the pain of elevated energy and grocery prices while businesses were facing widespread skill shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s much to discuss – everything from how we can boost the capacity and productivity of our economies, reduce cost-of-living pressures, work together to tackle climate change, strengthen our people-to-people linkages, support a resilient Indo-Pacific region and create more shared opportunities for our ­people,” Dr Chalmers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed wellbeing statement would not replace traditional economic indicators, such as gross domestic product or GDP per capita, but would complement them to provide a more informed picture of our quality of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Joseph Stiglitz, who won the 2001 Nobel prize in economics, told The Australian the metrics in the new wellbeing statement could measure life expectancy, climate change, inequality and inclusiveness outcomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Stiglitz said there could be an argument to measure racial inclusion in <b>Australia</b>, which would help gauge how Indigenous Australians were faring across multiple outcomes including education, health and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said existing economic indicators did “not capture wellbeing at all” and referred to the American experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The US GDP per capita is relatively high. It keeps going up and yet life expectancy is low relative to other advanced countries. It’s actually going down ... We have a society marked by huge inequality,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said large fractions of the American population had “not seen their income go up” while wages for low-income earners were “at the same level they were at 65 years ago adjusted for inflation”; gun violence remained a key problem. “These are all symptoms of a society and an economy not performing well,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Chalmers has already directed Treasury to devise an Australian approach to measuring “what matters” and make it a “focus of the budget in October”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he would dedicate Budget Statement 4 to a “broad-ranging discussion of our options, drawing on best practice around the world, as the basis of our ­engagement and further development. In the interim, I’ll be writing to my ministerial colleagues to ensure they have portfolio input into our considerations.” Economist Chris Richardson told The Australian a wellbeing statement should examine life ­expectancy and changes in inequality. “We know that GDP is a terrible measure, but it is something that is consistently compiled and broadly comparable over the years. The point isn’t ignore GDP. The point isL Can we better inform ourselves with other things?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To take an obvious point, GDP is a terrible measure for China because China is so busy building things that GDP is a considerable overstatement of underlying living standards.” Opposition Treasury spokesman Angus Taylor said “the best way to improve the wellbeing of Australians is to lower interest rates, contain inflation and help struggling families make ends meet. That’s what the Treasurer should be focused on.” Referencing the approach taken by Mr Robertson in <b>New Zealand</b>, Dr Chalmers identified worthwhile metrics for measuring wellbeing as including “improving <b>mental health</b>, reducing child poverty, addressing the inequalities faced by Indigenous people, thriving in a digital age, and transitioning to a low-emission economy”.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        Jacinda Ardern is taking home more rights and given us a 'wellbeing Budget'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealanders living in <b>Australia</b> could soon be allowed to vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's just one of the plans Prime Minsters Anthony Albanese and Jacinda Ardern have announced following a week-long visit from the <b>NZ</b> PM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albanese announced on Friday that he'll ask a parliamentary committee to consider whether New Zealanders who are living and working in <b>Australia</b> can have voting rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically Kiwis would need to become citizens here before being given rights to participate in elections and enjoy democracy sausages. Whereas Australians who have been living in <b>NZ</b> for more than a year can automatically vote there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ll be asking the (committee) to consider whether there’s a way to return to systems that have existed in the past of giving <b>New Zealand</b> people who are here in <b>Australia</b> — contributing to society, paying taxes, working — voting rights here in <b>Australia</b> as well,” Albanese said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We won’t pre-empt those processes, but it is a really commonsense position to at least examine over the coming months.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's Jacinda doing here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a busy couple of days for Ardern in <b>Australia</b>, who has been in town for events, photo ops and bilateral talks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albanese has hosted her for discussions in Sydney since Wednesday where she was accompanied by Kiwi business leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purpose of this trip, her second official visit in less than two months, was to discuss regional security, economic recovery, climate change and the strong ties between the two countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, and also hopefully lure Aussies back to holiday in The Land of the Long White Cloud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After touching down she headed to David Jones to show her support for Kiwi labels like Karen Walker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern launched the <b>NZ</b> Design edit at DJ with Kiwi designers Karen Walker and Kate Sylvester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ardern also delivered an eloquent addressed the the <span class="companylink">Lowy Institute</span> about foreign policy, trade and climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went hard on Russia and was tender about issues like equality and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kiwi prime minister does extremely well in the realm of international diplomacy, and is popular everywhere she travels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">twitter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And delivered a keynote address at <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">#JacindaArdern gets a standing ovation at #Harvard for #guncontrol and #abortion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since her arrival on the wider political stage in 2017, her aura, or vibe, has been nicknamed \"Jacindamania\".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But does Jacindamania translate for her at home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ardern was popular from the get-go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiktok</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just seven weeks out from the 2017 general election, she took on the position of leader of the <b>NZ</b> Labour Party and led it to victory to become Prime Minister. She also became the world's youngest female head of government at age 37.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labour Party under Arden’s leadership also went on to win the 2020 October election in a landslide victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pollsters Roy Morgan and Curia have been asking New Zealanders whether the country is heading in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from sometimes during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, large portions of Kiwis have always responded “Yes”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first <b>Covid lockdown</b>, back in April 2020, the highest positive value was 77% for \"right direction\".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has now dropped to 36%, and 50% of New Zealanders believe their country is going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist from The <b>New Zealand</b> Initiative Oliver Hartwich outlined in an article published in The Australian that the reason why Kiwis are no longer as happy with Ardern's performance is because of “the discrepancy between political promises and reality.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words: things may look good from the outside, but if you dig deeper you might get a different picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2019, Ardern and her finance minister Grant Robertson introduced a “wellbeing budget”, claiming it was the first of its kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then it prioritised things like <b>mental health</b>, reducing child poverty, Maori aspiration, the digital economy and the transition to a low-­emissions future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is a “wellbeing budget” and how is it different to a normal one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key difference to traditional budgets lies in the measurements used - focusing not just on (clears throat to channel Josh Frydenberg) ‘jobs and growth’, gross domestic product (GDP) and public debt, but also on health outcomes, environmental sustainability, and other more \"it's the vibe\" type lifestyle factors impacting the population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far it seems like it’s delivered mixed results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s start with housing in <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears it’s not just young Aussies who are struggling to buy a home in their own country. The average home in Auckland, as of February 2022, costs <b>NZ</b>$1.4m (roughly $1.3m AUD), which is 35 times more expensive than the average Kiwi income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing was one of the big issues in the 2017 election campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Labour promised to address housing affordability, reduce homelessness, and build 100,000 affordable KiwiBuild homes over the span of a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, it seems <b>New Zealand</b>’s housing crisis is worsening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> house prices have grown by almost 8.7% annually (over the course of five years) on average and KiwiBuild, so far, has delivered about 1300 homes – with only 98,700 to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does this mean for us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been banging on about the world-first \"wellbeing budget\" since 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week said he will emulate aspects of <b>New Zealand</b>’s financial planning model when he sits down to draw up his first budget in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday he confirmed the new government's books will include a new “wellbeing” statement that it will use to measure how Australians are faring in their daily lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hoped this will better inform policy development and ensure the ­nation is pursuing the “right kind of growth”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech to the <b>Australia New Zealand</b> Leadership Forum he outlined how and why Australians should judge the new government's policies \"against agreed markers of progress … That begins with measuring what matters - not instead of traditional economic indicators but in addition to.\"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and experts are looking at this notion with a raised eyebrow but are keen to hear more detail over the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">\"The question, at a time when the Reserve Bank is urging for budget restraint to stop inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates, is who pays for all this? For as important as social inclusion, environmental sustainability and <b>mental health</b> outcomes are, it all costs,\" Sky News business editor Ross Greenwood said.</p>

</div><div class="author">CAMERON MILNER </div><div>984 words</div><div>7 July 2022</div><div>The Australian</div><div>AUSTLN</div><div>Australian</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>© News Pty Limited. No redistribution is permitted. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say a week is a long time in politics, so I guess two years must be an eternity. This past week has seen the release of the seminal Coaldrake review into the Queensland government and the emergence of a refreshingly mature approach by governments, state and federal, to the third wave of <b>coronavirus</b> circulating in our community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Australians, we can be thankful to the public health advice that minimised the human death toll wrought by the past two years of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>. Being an island nation allowed us to shut borders and then each state exercised greater restrictions to varying degrees of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As democratic, freedom-loving Aussies, we ceded huge rights to the public health orders that were imposed a little over two years ago. We endured the closure of public services like schools and transport and adjusted for home schooling, as well as not being able to visit loved ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our police officers enforced intrastate movement restrictions. The worst restrictions were most certainly in Victoria, which had over 262 days of <b>lockdown</b>. The human cost, not just in fatalities, but in terms of <b>mental health</b>, businesses broken and basic removal of freedom of movement needs to be the new measure of the impacts of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>. Social ­interactions that drive our humanity were set aside to save lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those first two years, 2000 Australians lost their lives to <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>; in the past six months 8000 people have died of it in <b>Australia</b>. Yet this year, with four times as many people succumbing to this horrible virus, we have kept our economy open and freedom of movement has largely been restored across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The massive public debt-infused measures of JobKeeper are no longer needed and a more normal approach to fighting inflation, maintaining economic growth and living with <b>Covid</b> has been adopted by governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was great to see the federal Minister for Health, Mark Butler, alongside Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil, on Sunday announce the demolition of the last national border restrictions for people coming and going from <b>Australia</b>. On the same day, <span class="companylink">Queensland Health</span> Minister Yvette D’Ath said a return to mask wearing was not on the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to say <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> is defeated. We have transitioned to a more nuanced and mature strategy than the blunt instrument of locking people in their homes. A sector-by-sector approach to managing the harmful impacts of <b>Covid</b> works well for aged-care recipients and those in hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We still have huge issues to confront as a community in terms of the medium to longer-term impacts of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>. We need to deal with the huge waiting lists across <b>Australia</b> generated by the government-mandated delays to elective surgery. At the time they were accepted as necessary, but so is the quality of life afforded to people who are now waiting too long for hips, knees and other such operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to tackle as a national crisis the <b>mental health</b> effects of those who lost work, lost contact, and lost loved ones but were prevented from attending funerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our children in schools have suffered; they’ve lost so much time at a crucial age for developing social skills and making lasting friendships. We can’t underestimate the educational lag that will require direct assistance to rectify as students move through their primary, secondary and tertiary education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m encouraged that state and federal ministers have already identified these as priorities, but it will be up to the voting public to ensure these commitments are delivered. Our nation and its ongoing progress are intrinsically linked to a successful delivery of a fully fledged post-<b>Covid</b> plan for our economy and our society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globally, leaders are also embracing a more measured approach to <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> and no doubt our Prime Minister would have experienced this first hand in his travels. Back home, we need to open up freedom of choice for the fourth dose of vaccine; if you want it, why should there be restrictions given we all know we’ll need it to continue to live with <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same week as this measured and temperate response to the worst public health crisis since the Spanish flu 104 years ago, Professor Peter Coaldrake, a highly accomplished academic and public administrator, delivered a review that outlined significant and widespread recommendations for how to improve transparency and government accountability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coaldrake is no stranger to the Queensland public service, having been part of the original “Goss Squad” of Wayne Goss, Kevin Rudd and the newly anointed head of Prime Minister and Cabinet Dr Glyn Davis. He also counts Wayne Swan as a long-term mate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report deals with matters contemporaneous with the period of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> response and makes for compelling reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk should be lauded for committing to implementing the review’s recommendations in their entirety and to the letter. We will be a stronger nation as the citizens having entrusted so much to their governments in the past two years can have confidence that lessons have been learnt and how we initially reacted to <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> may now no longer be fit for purpose.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally, Queenslanders, having received such an insightful report from Coaldrake, will be watching to ensure the report and all its recommendations are implemented in full and that governments have equally learnt a new approach to delivering on the trust that we the citizens place in them.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthtech start-up Telecare is moving to capitalise on a ­<b>pandemic</b>-driven shift towards telehealth and virtual clinics, bringing on new investors as it builds out its vision of creating <b>Australia</b>’s leading chronic disease management platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 90 clinicians already signed up to its platform across 30 specialist areas, the Melbourne-based group has facilitated about 40,000 virtual appointments nationally, including remote parts of the country such as Norfolk ­Island and the Cocos Islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, founded before the <b>pandemic</b> in 2019, has landed a $2.2m seed funding round led by MedAngels and supported by LaunchVic’s Alice Anderson Fund, valuing it at $20m. It follows a previous oversubscribed pre-seed round of $700,000, of which $70,000 was derived from Telecare’s participation in accelerator program Startmate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telecare chief executive and co-founder Michael Wang said the current processes within the specialist medical system were extremely fragmented, resulting in a need for a platform that closed the loop for patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> has forced the medical industry towards technology solutions and now there is growing recognition that digital healthcare is here to stay,” Mr Wang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our seed funding means that we can continue to lead this revolution and meaningfully improve the experience of being inside the healthcare system for GPs, ­patients and specialists at scale and throughout <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve solved [the issue] for providing faster, easier and more affordable access to clinical specialists in <b>Australia</b>, and now we’re working on scaling our extensive in-house software to help automate the process of delivering telehealth so that everyone in the clinical communication chain is empowered to do the right thing at the right time.” Specialist shortages in rural and remote <b>Australia</b> had led to wait times of more than 12 months for some specialties, Mr Wang said, and the approximate wait time from GP referral to telehealth specialist consultation was one to three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know that faster intervention leads to better outcomes, not only for complex diseases but also for conditions such as diabetes, autism, childhood behavioural issues, <b>mental health</b> issues, ADHD – all of which tend to have long wait times,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s been an under-utilisation of technology in this space that has ultimately cost patients and specialists in various ways. We realised there was an opportunity to generate efficiency through tech that vertically integrates along the patient journey, from GP referral through to specialist virtual appointment, in-person diagnostics, medication plans and finally back to the GP again. “We will continue to raise capital and bring on investors who have industry resources and industry knowledge and we want to continue to vertically integrate with more services to give ­patients an even better ­experience.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A belief in the teachings of the Bible remains the cornerstone of modern western society On reading about his demise, Mark Twain replied: “The report of my death is an exaggeration”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those commentators arguing Christianity and the Catholic Church are mortally wounded based on the 2021 census results regarding religion, the same response applies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With newspaper headlines like “Abandoning God: Christianity plummets as ‘non-religious’ surges in census”, “Losing our religion as Christianity plummets” and comments like “<b>Australia</b> has become strikingly more godless over the last decade”, it would be easy to conclude religion is in its death throes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing could be further from the truth. While there’s no doubt the number of Australians identifying as Christian has declined from 52 per cent in 2016 to just under 44 per cent in the 2021 census, the reality is religion is still a powerful and potent force in <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With older Australians, some 60 per cent have a religious affiliation and during the two years of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> crisis, when churches were not forced to close, there was a noticeable improvement in attendance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s also true religious schools, hospitals, aged-care facilities, charities and social welfare organisations underpin and enrich Australian society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to what Heidi Nicholl, the CEO of Humanists <b>Australia</b>, argues in a column published in the Sydney Morning Herald that religious organisations should no longer be tax exempt, the reality is without such mainly Christian bodies, <b>Australia</b>’s social, health and educational fabric would unravel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As noted by <b>Australia</b>’s one-time deputy prime minister John Anderson, it’s also true <b>Australia</b>’s political and legal systems, plus much of our music, literature and art is deeply imbued with Christian beliefs and virtues, especially the New Testament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concepts such as liberty and freedom, and committing to social justice and the common good are Christian in origin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of heralding the demise of Christianity, what secular critics should contemplate is what the latest Census tells us about what is described as an increasingly godless society. The Census reveals <b>mental health</b> tops the list ahead of asthma and arthritis as the most common health problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While exacerbated by the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>, there is no doubt Australians, especially young men where suicide is the most common form of death, are suffering high levels of anxiety and depression. It’s also true <b>Australia</b> is suffering a drug epidemic where, in addition to hard drugs including cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy, high rates of opioid addiction and alcoholism indicate widespread anxiety and societal breakdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While religion is not guaranteed as a panacea enabling one to cope with the traumas, self-doubt, suffering and pain life inevitably brings, believing in the spiritual and transcendent and that Jesus suffered on the cross for our sakes provides reassurance and comfort not all is lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As argued by the Christian mystic Julian of Norwich: “Let nothing disturb you. Let nothing frighten you. Everything passes away except God” and “all shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author of the Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, when explaining the millions killed and starved under communism and fascism, argues the reason is “men have forgotten God. The failings of human consciousness, deprived of its divine dimension, have been a determining factor in all the major crimes of this century”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long seen as a vitally important social institution, marriage is also in poor health with the census revealing there are now a million single parent families where 75 per cent of the single parents are women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a product of a broken family where our mother was forced to cope after dad left, I know from personal experience growing up with two parents is preferable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children raised by both parents, in the majority of cases, offers a stable and secure upbringing. The research shows boys, in particular, need strong, positive fathers who mentor their sons about what constitutes virtuous masculinity and how best to lead a fulfilling and enriching life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s no doubt, since the birth of Christ, those professing to be Christians have been guilty of a multitude of sins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Spanish Inquisition, the pogroms against the Jews or the corruption of medieval and Renaissance popes, there is much to forgive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Include the evil crime of pedophilia and there’s no doubt secular critics are right to criticise Christianity and the Church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, it is important to appreciate the inherent value of Christian morals and virtues and the way Christianity underpins our institutions and way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally as important, in an increasingly materialistic and sterile world, is the need to experience the spiritual and transcendent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Bible states: “Man does not live by bread alone” and whether Michelangelo’s Pietà, Rachmaninov’s Vespers, Milton’s Paradise Lost or Dostoyevsky’s Crime And Punishment, Christianity offers a window to human flourishing and a sense of the divine.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aussie quick raring to go after <b>mental health</b> break HANNAH Darlington has revealed her cricketing future after her shock call to withdraw from <b>Australia</b>’s World Cup campaign earlier this year for <b>mental health</b> reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising Australian star has signed a three-year extension at the Sydney Thunder and said her decision to take an extended break from the game last season was the “best of my career”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, cross-town rivals the Sydney Sixers have re-signed experienced representative star Erin Burns for a further two seasons, as the WBBL recruitment period gains speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Covid</b> protocols prevented Burns from playing in the WBBL with the Sixers last season after she missed the start of the campaign to be by her wife’s side for the birth of their son, Jack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intrigue surrounds Australian greats Ellyse Perry and Rachael Haynes, who are yet to sign new deals with their respective clubs, the Sixers and Thunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 100 days to go until WBBL08, all clubs are preparing to drop big-name player announcements this week. The Renegades on Monday confirmed that big-hitting ­Indian star Harmanpreet Kaur would return after being named player of the tournament in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast bowler Darlington was thrust into the hot seat as a teenager to captain Sydney Thunder and NSW last summer and is one of the most ­exciting prodigies in the country, having also made her debut for <b>Australia</b> against India during the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darlington was set to be a part of what proved to be a victorious ODI World Cup campaign for <b>Australia</b> in <b>New Zealand</b> as a reserve player, but decided to withdraw to look after her <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing after a trying WBBL on the road in travelling hubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-year-old has no regrets and is back at pre-season training feeling she’s made a major breakthrough in setting up her future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a big summer and looking back it was one that had a lot of ups and downs,” Darlington said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was awesome to make my Australian debut and that was a dream-come-true moment … but the season did build up and continue on and taking the break away from the game at the back end of the year was probably the best decision I’ve made, to make sure I am in the best head space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a decision I made in the Ashes, and to leave the group and see them go on to win the World Cup was a hard moment, but also knowing the group and how much they deserved to win that World Cup was pretty special to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I knew the decision was best for me and I had all the support I could have wanted to now be able to come back first day of pre-season and get started.” Darlington, born and raised in Western Sydney and a proud member of the Kamilaroi people, said the security of a long-term deal with the Thunder meant the world as she tried to remain a one-club player for the duration of her career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was one-year deals or a two-year deal previously, so it’s nice to have that deal in place,” she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it <b>Covid</b> Redux or <b>Covid</b> 2.0: Just when most of us thought – or at least hoped – that we had put the <b>pandemic</b> behind us, new variants of <b>coronavirus</b> are rearing their highly infectious heads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And combined with almost zero natural immunity to the flu after two years of lockdowns and other restrictions, <b>Australia</b> is heading into a winter not just of discontent but discomfort, disease and – yes – even death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, the pressing question is: what do we do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first and most obvious answer is not what we did last time. We cannot simply return to the blunt and brutal measures of restricting movement and locking people down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only now are we starting to see the true impact of the last wave of lockdowns, ranging from kids falling behind at school to skyrocketing divorce rates to turbocharged inflation, not to mention the collective <b>mental health</b> toll on our nation – and especially the young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we need to respond smarter, not harder. And that means making sure we are as vaccinated as possible – including up to four shots for those in vulnerable cohorts – as well as developing new vaccines to target emerging variants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tellingly, this is what two leading medical figures have ­alluded to in recent days, with Queensland’s Chief Health Officer John Gerrard pointedly saying he opposes the reintroduction of mask mandates and other restrictions and that we should instead be focusing on extra booster shots for those aged over 65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Griffith University Infectious Diseases and Immunology director Nigel McMillan has said that new targeted vaccines will be the way forward, as well as antiviral treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, smarter, not harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the real hard truth of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> is that no matter what any of us thought or hoped, the <b>pandemic</b> was never going to be completely behind us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the experts have warned us time and again, we need to learn to live with the virus. And yet it is clear from some of the rhetoric about the inevitable rise in cases that many commentators were clearly just paying lip service to this fact – or perhaps had failed to adequately comprehend what living with the virus actually entailed. Thankfully, these panicked voices are increasingly marginalised in what is left of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> debate, and the vast majority of us simply want to get our lives back.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We still don’t know what happened to all the kids who slipped through the cracks during <b>lockdown</b>, writes Joe Hildebrand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT is the world’s oldest political truism, that you never hold an inquiry unless you know what the outcome’s going to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so when Health Minister Mark Butler announces an inquiry into the Morrison government’s vaccine deals you can bet your last brass tack that it’s not going to look good for the former mob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we also know this because it was blindingly obvious and universally broadcast, printed and shouted from every rooftop at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is the point?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presumably the new government has access to the contracts without having to order an inquiry into them and is perfectly capable of making better deals on its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As things stand now, we know vaccines work, everyone has plentiful access to them and we will soon be manufacturing our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an old joke that Elvis’s only drug problem was supply. It is certainly not ours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so if there is going to be an inquiry into anything <b>Covid</b>-related, it should be into everything <b>Covid</b> related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because I, like millions of others of Australians, have more than a few questions I’d like to see answered before the next <b>pandemic</b> rolls around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are just some of them: Do all states and territories in <b>Australia</b> now have well-resourced and state-of-the-art contact tracing that can keep the need for restrictions to a minimum?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why was NSW able to track and trace so successfully for so long – thus avoiding several lockdowns – while Victoria was not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which restrictions were most effective in preventing the spread of the virus and which were not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was the closure of beaches and playgrounds necessary?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did the lockdowns affect poorer citizens and families required to isolate in apartments and small homes compared to affluent Australians with larger houses and gardens?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did the restrictions affect blue-collar and self-employed workers who were unable to work from home versus those who could comfortably do so?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the efficacy of mask mandates in a mass-vaccinated population? What were the <b>mental health</b> impacts of lockdowns on younger populations versus older populations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did the scanning of QR codes remain compulsory in NSW even after nobody was monitoring or using them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why were schools closed against the advice of the nation’s top medical experts who said they were safe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many students’ learning suffered as a result of school closures? How many Australian children disappeared from the school system after these closures?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, the biggest question of them all, where are they now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s start local. In NSW it was reported in evidence to a 2020 inquiry set up by the Teachers Federation that after the first <b>lockdown</b> alone more than 3000 public school students simply never returned to school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the same time the charity <span class="companylink">Save The Children</span> warned that across the globe almost 10 million students could drop out of school because of lockdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an example, let’s go to one of the most difficult and disadvantaged parts of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our closest neighbour to the north, Papua New Guinea, had no preschool at all until 2020 when UNICEF <b>Australia</b> started a groundbreaking program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a godsend for the children of PNG and a linchpin in the fight against poverty and disadvantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the lockdowns came.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One pioneering volunteer educator had a class of 24 children. After <b>lockdown</b> only 15 came back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we had the <b>lockdown</b> due to <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, some kids went home and were scared to come back after we closed the school for one month,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was in a report by UNICEF <b>Australia</b>. Its conclusion was unequivocal. “UNICEF <b>Australia</b> is calling for schools to be the last places to close and the first to reopen,” the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Educators and experts across the board and across the planet have issued the same cry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet here in <b>Australia</b>, one of the most affluent and supposedly transparent democracies in the world, we still don’t have an adequate answer on why schools were closed in the first place nor an assurance it will never happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, most importantly, we still don’t know what happened to all the kids who slipped through the cracks. As long as we’re having an inquiry, how about we have an inquiry into that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the night of Tuesday, August 10, last year, Australians sat down to fill in the 2021 census. The statistics, released this week, reveal a snapshot of a changing nation.</p>
