<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Lipsham learned to be rich the hard way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former truck driver won $19 million on Lotto when he was shifting dirt north of Auckland in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early 2020, Lipsham’s <b>mental wellbeing</b> had been overwhelmed by the responsibilities of wealth and all that came with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $19m turned to $12m as those to whom he was close — and people he hadn’t heard from for years — lined up to share his good fortune. And there was one, particularly, who nearly broke him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham watched the money running out of his account — and with it went the feeling he had control over his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These experiences sank him into the darkest of holes where he was thinking the unimaginable — wishing he’d never won the money, and worse, that he didn’t want to be around to spend it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Paeroa-born dad-of-two Lipsham is finally getting the hang of being rich. His fortune has grown so it now exceeds his original winnings. Happy and whole, he’s engaged to be married and excited about making his first trip overseas for the wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He’s learned a lot along the way and now he’s ready to share the good, and bad, of becoming an overnight multi-millionaire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham was working as a truck driver on Warkworth’s holiday highway in November 2017 when his life changed forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had moved to the town a month earlier because he always followed the work. Home was a rented house not far from State Highway 1. “When I saw it, I thought ‘wow, this is a nice place. I wouldn’t mind owning it’.” There was a lot of work left in the highway. It was work he liked. His father drove trucks and he drove trucks. Lipsham carted clay out and brought metal in. It’s a huge job — 19km, costing $710m to make State Highway 1 about 10 minutes shorter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lotto had been on his mind. When he blew out candles on his recent 53rd birthday cake, he wished for a win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I started dreaming numbers and seeing numbers around. And I went to bed and I started writing these numbers down that I was dreaming about. So I put them on to tickets and went and bought some Lotto tickets and, um, yeah. Something amazing happened.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On November 28, 2017, Lipsham drives to work with a clutch of Lotto tickets in the glovebox of his Honda Odyssey . He’s saying gidday to those he knows among the 200 or so people on site and chatter starts after a radio news story about an unclaimed Powerball prize of $19m. Workmates knew he’d taken time off to go into town and buy a ticket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hey bro,” someone says, “someone at Warkworth won the Powerball and it hasn’t been claimed.” Lipsham puts on a total poker face and says: “Yeah, that was me — I’ve got 12 months to claim it, plenty of time left.” He still cracks up over that because, really, he didn’t think for a second he had won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He headed home that night, stopping at New World to pick up food for dinner and check his Lotto tickets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Next thing you know, the lady behind the counter — her eyes went like basketballs.” Lipsham’s watching the young woman pacing back and forth, then stopping to read instructions on the computer. She reads aloud: “This is an substantial amount of money. Please call HQ immediately.” So she picks up the phone and Lipsham says he’s standing there thinking, ‘have I won $1000?’, and then he’s thinking maybe $2000 or — getting crazy — what if it’s $10,000?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman at the counter hands the phone over and a man’s voice says: “Congratulations. You are the winner of $19,166,667.66. How do you feel?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham replies simply, “all right”, because it turns out getting a handle on the enormity of the win would take years. He jots down the phone number to organise claiming the money, tells the guy in line behind him “I just won Powerball”, gets a handshake then leaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five minutes later Lipsham pulls up at home where he lives with a cousin and baulks at going inside. “I couldn’t get out of the car. I couldn’t even look inside ... because they might see the way I’m looking and think something was wrong.” He sits there for a bit, gets out and slips into the kitchen briefly then announces, “I’m just going up the road”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just wanted to go to the water. I wanted to go to the sea.” Lipsham drove to the coast, parked, walked across sand exposed by low tide and sat down in the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that’s where he stayed for the next few hours, mind blown. “I don’t know, when I was sitting in that water, if it was doing any good, really. I didn’t know what to expect or how to expect what to expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How do I take this? How do I soak this in? How do I receive this? I suppose it was a bit of a numb feeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Back in the day, $10 was a lot of money for me. Ten bucks, like, ‘hey bro, can I borrow 10 bucks? Oh no, man. I need this.’ You know?” Lipsham sat there until night fell then he figured it was time to go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you should ever be so lucky as to win a fortune, Mark Lipsham has some advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Don’t tell anyone. Don’t tell your partner. Don’t tell your mother, your father, your sister, your brother, your best friend, your anyone. Don’t tell no one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He didn’t go out of his way to tell people. It’s not his nature to boast. And some who learned of his good fortune took it as that — someone else’s good fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others who learned of it saw it as an opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first person told was the guy in line at the supermarket, then his flatmate cousin when he got back from the beach. And then his boss the next morning when he turned up to work but found his concentration so shot he felt a danger driving his truck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham’s boss told him to go home, so the Lotto winner cleaned out his truck, knowing he wasn’t ever coming back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Friday came and the money was in the bank, word had spread. “Next minute, everyone started calling me. ‘Hey, giz a loan, giz this, giz that’. There’s people I didn’t even know from around <b>New Zealand</b>, people from overseas ringing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’re getting phone calls all the time. You’re getting messages all the time. That’s the stuff that was hard for me. That was hard for me because I didn’t know how to deal with it.” And that was it for the next two years — a long line of hands out looking for a handout and Lipsham not knowing how to reconcile his good fortune with all those who wanted a piece of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It got pretty bad. It threw me into a state of depression, stress, frustration. What to do? How do I deal with this? Am I supposed to give them what they ask for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How’s that making me feel if I don’t give it? Do they think I’m an arsehole because I’m not giving it to them? It really shut me down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I couldn’t go to people and tell them how I was feeling because I felt like I should be in control of what I’m dealing with and I didn’t want to be that person feeling that I didn’t know what I was doing with what I had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So I was trying to be that person who knew what he was doing and I was suppressing all those feelings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, Lipsham was in a dark place. He hadn’t gone wild with the money — he was still in the Warkworth rental — but $19m shrank to $15m as he stretched his generosity to match the requests made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over that time, he gave money to people for what sounded like good reasons only to find they had spent it on something else — and come back to hit him up for more. He watched his bank balance drop and didn’t know how to stop the slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve always been a person who liked to give. I knew I had to pull it up somewhere, stop it and look at it. Just when and where and how? Shall I wait till it gets to a limit? Shall I stop it now? I was still feeling the obligation that I had to give.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding his sense of unease was the loss of structure. Lipsham had joined the army at 19 for nine years, drove trucks to a schedule and worked his whole life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a fortune in the bank, he didn’t need to get up in the morning. Need became want and — once he had bought a few new cars — he didn’t know what he wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I found that very hard . . . and it led me to a place of problems — problems with myself, more than anything else, because I wasn’t operating how I always operated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By October 2019, Lipsham was lonely and in torment. A neighbour in whom he confided was also struggling and had found someone who could help — a clairvoyant who apparently knew about money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham, lost in himself, said: “I could use someone like that.” And that’s how he met Kim Helmbright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That first time, he says, she parked outside his rented home and, as she walked towards the front door, stopped and just didn’t move for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she continued, greeting Lipsham with a big hug and a kiss on the cheek, he asked why she had stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her reply, he says, was to look at the photograph on the wall of his deceased mother and tell him: “I was just talking to your mum in the garden.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took seven months for Lipsham to decide Helmbright, who is now 51, was not the answer to his problems. By the time that happened, his bank balance had dropped to $12m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They met in October 2019 and parted ways in May 2020. In that time, Helmbright took on his financial and legal affairs and gave health and life counselling. Thousands of texts reviewed by the Herald on Sunday show Lipsham came to rely on Helmbright for almost everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those messages, Helmbright showered praise over Lipsham’s exercise and gym work while offering advice on stress. One message offered breathing advice, adding: “And quietly say to yourself . . . I am Mark and I’m okay. I am here and now. I am safe. I am loved. I am needed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His text messages are loaded with gratitude. “I don’t smile much,” he wrote to her. “I have noticed the sensations lately when I have been smiling and it’s different.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, Lipsham says, Helmbright advised distance from some family and friends. He recalls “the word hermit was used”. Text messages show Helmbright offered technical advice about not opening emails and swapping phones which, Lipsham says, served to isolate him from others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s clear from the messages that Helmbright’s influence sometimes pushed Lipsham in directions he wanted to go. He steered clear of alcohol, with her encouragement, and moved on from the Warkworth rental in anticipation of becoming a homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there were times when Lipsham made choices with which she disagreed. “She made me cry a few times. She was actually telling me off and made me cry.” Lipsham says she told him: “I’m very expensive and I like to be paid when I ask for it.” And so he did, transferring $70,000 over the course of their contact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was a payment of $2.8m on December 2, 2019, that wound up in the High Court at Whangārei. Helmbright claimed it was payment for services. Lipsham said he sent her the money to buy houses on his behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money was transferred just before Lipsham flew from Kerikeri to Nelson — his first time flying, first time in the South Island — where one of his two daughters lives with her children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a trip meant to last a fortnight but it stretched to months as, Lipsham says, he was told there were delays buying property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham got back to Auckland on one of the last flights before the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 lockdown</b> in March 2020 and moved into a motel. As <b>lockdown</b> passed, Lipsham’s frustration grew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, he texted her: “I don’t know what is happening with the house, with my money. I used to get 32k-38k a month. Now I am only getting approx 9k a month. I need to hear answers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helmbright, who once texted him at 4am, refused to engage at 9.47pm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Six weeks of no contact,” she texted, “and you message me out of the blue. I am not answering your call as I am not going to have you talking to me in that manner.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn’t quite the end but it took only a week before Lipsham was texting to no reply: “Are you going to call Kim? When are you going to call? This is not good.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that would have been it if coincidence hadn’t introduced Lipsham to a man with — to borrow from the movie Taken — a “very particular set of skills”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Lipsham says: “I like anything with a steering wheel and side mirrors.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s how he came to meet Matt Blomfield, who also likes a showpiece on wheels. They use the same mechanics and chatted about cars while waiting for work to be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blomfield is a former pizza franchisee who fought an infamous decade-long defamation fight, often representing himself. In that time, he’s turned those skills into a legal support business that finds solutions to people’s problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the point they met, Lipsham’s <b>mental wellbeing</b> was again on the slide. Helmbright had gone from being his touchstone for balance to a fresh source of anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought it was good help,” Lipsham says of their contact. “In the end, it really wasn’t help at all. I actually got conned and out of quite a lot of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought to myself, ‘I’m just going let it go’. I’ve been through this stressful time. I don’t want to go through any more of it. I’m just going to go with what I’ve got. And what I had left was about $12 million.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day they met, Blomfield left the mechanics and those working on Lipsham’s car suggested Blomfield as the answer to his problems. “He’s like a pitbull,” Lipsham was told. “He’ll go in there and he’ll come back with it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Blomfield and Lipsham met again they talked about Helmbright and the $2.8m. They talked about getting it back and how Lipsham could look after what was left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blomfield’s search for Lipsham’s money revealed Helmbright had bought properties in Northland in early 2020. That July, he slapped legal freezing orders on both properties, alleging Helmbright had bought the land with money “fraudulently” obtained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, at the High Court in Whangārei, lawyers for Lipsham asked Associate Judge Dani Gardiner to order Helmbright to produce evidence to support her claim the $2.8m was paid for the services provided to Lipsham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of the contract between the pair, Helmbright said, was a “freelancing agreement” she claimed was cobbled together from documents online and signed by Lipsham with the date of October 4, 2019. Lipsham told the court he had signed the agreement in December 2019, when the $2.8m was transferred so Helmbright could buy him a house or houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was when detective work by Blomfield’s staff showed the agreement to be an almost perfect match for a “freelancing agreement” sold by a US-based legal document company. When such an agreement was purchased, it left an electronic footprint — an emailed receipt and a credit card transaction — which would show the date the contract was created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Associate Judge Gardiner found Helmbright “must have . . . downloaded and paid” for the agreement and ordered Helmbright produce evidence of payment and purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham won’t talk about how matters ended, saying a settlement agreement doesn’t allow him to do so. Helmbright denies the allegation of fraud in the caveat document but has yet to respond to other questions from the Herald on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, documents filed with <span class="companylink">Land Information <b>NZ</b></span> show in the weeks after the judgment both Northland properties — one in Ōkaihau and one in Waipapa — were transferred from Helmbright to interests controlled by Lipsham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two houses join a property portfolio that didn’t exist when Lipsham and Blomfield met two years ago. It’s the result of Blomfield asking Lipsham what he wanted to do with the money he had left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham’s response — what he always wanted, really — was to make sure the heavy weight of responsibility that came with his extraordinary good luck was recognised with good management. Blomfield’s legal services company morphed to manage Lipsham’s fortune, which has doubled since that chance meeting two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lipsham’s now in a good place, preparing to move into the under-stated but stylish Riverhead house being built as his new home. His first overseas trip and upcoming marriage to a woman he met a couple of years ago lie ahead. He’s asked to keep her part of his life private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing where his new home’s deck will be, looking across the Upper Waitematā Harbour, Lipsham can point to three houses he owns across the water. And there are other investment properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says, laughing: “If there’s any money disappearing, it’s me making it disappear!” Above the new house, there’s an $880,000 squat red Lamborghini in the garage of the cottage where the couple are currently living. The car is worth as much as the government valuation on Lipsham’s old Warkworth house, which Blomfield organised for him to buy at auction. Lipsham always liked that place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is structure back in his life. “I had to rebuild the structure in me. I had to put it back and it took a long time to get that structure back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Structure came through transparency. Blomfield — or his staff — email regular updates on all aspects of managing a fortune. It gives Lipsham a reason to get up in the morning — a need to manage his future, rather than be victim to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everyone says happiness comes from within,” says Lipsham. “Since I was young, I’ve always looked for happiness because I didn’t know how to find happiness. And I was looking for it out there, over there, in that person or that person. I was trying to find happiness. I didn’t know how to look inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This fortune has created a space for me and this space is quite a big space. It’s a feeling of freedom. And in that space, there’s a lot of growth in there. It’s right there and it’s happening . . . I can see things happening in front of me.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a rare lucid tweet last week, the world’s richest man Elon Musk affirmed his political sanity by declaring: “I support the left half of the Republican Party and the right half of the Democratic Party!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of falling in an unrepresented gap between party political extremes is very relatable to me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Musk followed that up with a less relatable tweet about buying <span class="companylink">Manchester United</span>. He says that was a joke. Nice one Elon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <b>New Zealand</b> politics there is one key area where policy debate seems to be falling through the gap in a broader ideological scrap. The skills shortage is the biggest issue facing business this year. It is also one of the biggest issues facing the whole economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s feeding the biggest issue: inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it’s a better problem to have than mass unemployment and business failure, it still contributes to recessionary risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If businesses really can’t get staff then they just have to do less business. That limits the capacity for economic growth in the productive part of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s an issue where we don’t seem to be getting any clear pragmatic policy on either side of the political fence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the Government is getting it wrong on immigration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I understand the theory of the immigration reset policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade of very high immigration, it makes some sense to try for a more targeted policy. But in practice, this is a very tough time to be overhauling the policy. And it could cost us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As former National leader Simon Bridges (in his new role as Auckland Business Chamber boss) pointed out last week, the worker shortage is a global phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that just means we’re in an even more competitive race to attract talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skilled migrants can pick and choose from the US, UK, Canada and <b>Australia</b>. They will inevitably flow to where the policies are most welcoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a purely administrative level, the opening and closing of borders and the complexity of the <b>pandemic</b> mean Immigration <b>NZ</b> is already stretched. It is struggling to effectively implement the policy and to process the visa applications businesses desperately need to be cleared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also think National’s latest policy moves on the labour shortage miss the mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deputy leader Nicola Willis touched on the immigration issue last week at the party conference. But National decided the star of its policy announcement show was a plan to get tough on dole bludgers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leader Christopher Luxon announced that (with some social support in place) it is prepared to cut the benefits of those it deems work-averse. That would include those currently in the Jobseeker Support — Health Condition or Disability category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics on the left have been quick to call this dog-whistle politics and argue it ignores complex social issues underpinning long-term benefit dependence. But that’s not why I think the policy focus is unhelpful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting tough on beneficiaries is ideological, not pragmatic — it is not the solution employers are looking for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may play well to National’s more conservative base — although it could just see them scrapping over votes with Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I certainly do hear a lot of angry voices complaining about benefit numbers being too high, despite the low unemployment rate and the obvious worker shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people have headed off down a rabbit-hole of blaming Stats <b>NZ</b> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others feel Labour’s softer policy approach has effectively allowed dole bludgers to sneak on to the Health and Disability benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s true those numbers did rise sharply through 2020 and 2021 — perhaps something socially disruptive happened in those years, who can remember?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, Jobseeker Benefit numbers are still higher than 2017 — although they are trending back into line with the unemployment data. Regardless, I’m not hearing many employers argue that what they need is more unqualified, socially disengaged, possibly mentally-ill workers on the payroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a difficult point for the left to make — because it’s not very politically correct — but I’ll say it: many of the people National is talking about are unemployable. If you’ve successfully shifted across to the health and disability benefit on the basis of <b>mental illness</b> then you probably do have a few issues, whether you’re faking or not. It’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As much as we should aim collectively to help these people improve their mental outlook and engage with the world, it shouldn’t fall to already stressed business owners to manage the rehabilitation process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour Party policy holds that a long period of sustained low unemployment will help gradually shift the dial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s great that basic jobs on a reasonable wage are available for those who decide that they want to make a change. But that’s the long game and business needs help now. <b>New Zealand</b> needs business to keep firing across this difficult patch in the economic cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Government it’s not just a case of appeasing business owners — who are probably unlikely to be Labour voters anyway. Immigration can help us avoid recession and speed the path back to higher levels of growth in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might require softening of Labour’s policy reform for a while. It certainly means more resources and attention for the embattled workers trying to process visa applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if National wants to stand-up as a champion of economic growth, it needs to sharpen its focus on immigration and hone policy that will help business compete internationally for the workers it actually needs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Pandemic</b> resulted in more pressure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">on pilots, university survey finds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stress levels among airline pilots skyrocketed during the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>, putting their <b>mental health</b> at risk, according to a new university study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Survey data collected from pilots in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America reveals that 75.5 per cent of them were stressed about their uncertain future, anti-social working hours and the “divergence in values” between pilots and management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">University of South <b>Australia</b></span> senior lecturer in aviation Dr Silvia Pignata said the research found stress was especially high among long-haul and ultralong-haul pilots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-haul pilots, however, enjoyed a break from their normal flying schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pilots’ union in <b>New Zealand</b> says <b>quarantine</b>, <b>isolation</b> and attitudes to crew who flew overseas when borders were closed were stressful, though measures to help ease those issues had helped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">University of South <b>Australia</b></span> study of 49 pilots between September and November — when flying was gradually ramping up again — found short-haul and medium-haul pilots had the lowest level of strain while the long-haul pilots had the highest stress level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pignata told the Herald high stress levels could be dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If people are stressed — not just pilots — it makes us more prone to lack of concentration, memory issues and you’re not thinking as clearly as you should be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This resulted in fatigue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anyone working in aviation should have lower levels of stress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general population in <b>Australia</b> scores 0-1 on a <b>mental health</b> scale while long-haul pilots scored 1.28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are some issues there,” said Pignata. “Long-haul pilots were the first to lose their flying duties, they had worse job security.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airlines are now needing more pilots so job insecurity was not one of the primary stressors. Instead, there were other concerns, said Pignata.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the moment, particularly in <b>Australia</b>, the airline industry is going through a tough period with increased passenger traffic; there’s not enough resourcing to cope with that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings should be a wake-up call for the industry to bring in targeted workplace measures to support pilots and mitigate pilot stress, Pignata and her fellow researchers told a recent conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grounded planes during <b>Covid</b> and the ongoing disruption to flight schedules have added to pilots’ stress, with 46 to 82 per cent of pilots impacted by the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The issue of work stress has been neglected by the aviation industry, even before the <b>pandemic</b>,” Pignata said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Due to consumer demand for travel, airlines strive to keep their fleet in the air for as long as possible. Higher turnover rates mean more flight legs, increased workloads and higher stress levels for pilots. The uncertainty around the industry and conflicts with management over the past two years has just added to their stress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous studies have highlighted the mental fatigue that short-haul pilots experience due to flying multiple routes in a typical day, when pilots’ heart rates can reach 88 beats per minute during landing. Repeated take-offs and landings may exacerbate this stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, long-haul flights play havoc with pilots’ body clocks, as they fly across multiple time zones and work irregular hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pignata said that minimal research had been undertaken on job stress among pilots, and in the long run this may threaten the aviation industry’s level of safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Added to that is the negative impact of the recent <b>pandemic</b>, which only increases the need for aviation authorities to look deeper into pilots’ <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Ridling, president of the <b>NZ</b> Airline Pilots’ Association (NZALPA), flew long-haul routes himself throughout the <b>pandemic</b> and agreed with many of the survey’s findings, but said there was good communication among pilots and with employers here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From a long-haul perspective, we were trapped in hotels and the way we were treated was very mentally fatiguing. When we went overseas we were escorted to hotel rooms and locked in them and then there were issues when we came home with having to test and isolate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were robust systems within NZALPA which has a long-established peer assistance network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re small enough and we’re able to monitor each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the <b>pandemic</b> <span class="companylink">Air <b>New Zealand</b></span> laid off about 300 pilots, with some taking voluntary redundancy or accepting early retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridling said <span class="companylink">Air <b>NZ</b></span> chief executive Greg Foran had been very supportive of pilots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He’s always encouraging people and making sure they’re looking after themselves.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways the <b>pandemic</b> had helped some people deal with <b>mental health</b> issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As an industry and a country, we’re probably more aware of mental wellness in all walks of life. <b>Covid</b> has allowed us to encourage people to come forward and speak up when we’re having problems, a bit like we’ve done with alcohol and drugs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now travel had largely recovered, pilots were dealing with stresses they were more accustomed to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s no more stressful but we are very busy. The rosters have gone from zero to maximum flying hours. The bounce has been a lot more than anyone expected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pilots were good at divorcing themselves from the impact of disruption and public backlash following cancelled flights around the world over the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most pilots are not part of the processes going on outside of the plane.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealanders are grasping to manage the impact of physical activity on <b>covid</b> symptoms and their perception of physical performance, fatigue and exhaustion during stay-at-home orders, Exercise <b>NZ</b> chief executive Richard Beddie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a new global study has found physically activity is a preventative against <b>covid</b>, almost 40 percent less hospitalisations for people who are physically active. Exercise also helps with those who are in lock downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study in the British Medical Journal calls on recommendations to be made to support physical exercise, given the clear benefits of it has in the immediate and long term for people, Beddie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need a more holistic public health response as many immunologists appear not to grasp the benefits of exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would be so happy to have a public debate on the issue with Otago university professor Michael Baker about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today, I call on the government to work with ExerciseNZ around clear messages for activity during <b>covid</b>, but more significantly how physical activity is preventative and has no negative side effects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cologne Public Health Department study looked at how people who exercised during <b>covid</b> lockdowns benefitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beddie says the study confirmed people with acute and long-term positive effects of <b>covid</b> clearly benefitted from exercise during <b>lockdown</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Physical activity is considered a protective factor for non-communicable diseases, but due to the restrictions of daily life, less physical activity was observed during the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The study found people who were active during <b>quarantine</b> felt fitter, less tired and less exhausted during this period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The benefits of exercise should be repeatedly emphasised during subsequent medical care, and people should be encouraged to exercise or exercise more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>pandemic</b> has had an enormous impact on human life worldwide, with considerable economic, health, economic and psychosocial consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the absence of possible therapeutic countermeasures and vaccinations that only became available in Germany at the end of 2020, various contact restrictions and curfews were imposed to protect high-risk groups and prevent an overload of the health system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The research showed people who exercised more during the initial <b>covid</b>-related restrictions had better <b>mental health</b> and well-being than those who did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Physically inactive infected individuals had a more severe disease course of <b>covid</b> than active ones."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archie Brothers and Holey Moley to donate profits on 6 September</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;Combining charity and cheer for a worthy cause, Funlab, the masterminds behind the beloved Holey Moley Golf Club and Archie Brothers Cirque Electriq are set to deliver their first ever <b>New Zealand</b> annual Day of Fun - a charity partnership with Youthline <b>NZ</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After having great success overseas, Funlab's Day of Fun will be making its way to <b>New Zealand</b>'s shores where Kiwis will be invited to help raise much-needed funds for young people in need. On the 6th September, proceeds from Funlab's Auckland entertainment venues will go directly to Youthline <b>NZ</b> which provides support to 12-24 year olds who are struggling with their <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when <b>mental health</b> support and social interaction is more important than ever, Funlab is on a mission to raise and donate more than $15,000 through activities on the day. In line with this, Youthline workers will also be given their own day of fun at Funlab venues to say thank you for all the important work they do, and continue to do for Kiwis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help encourage Aucklanders to support this inaugural event, Funlab will reduce all activity pricing to $5 per activity across all its venues for the duration of Day of Fun. Whether owning the arcades at Archie Brothers or sinking putts at Holey Moley, Funlab has a Day of Fun activity that is sure to excite and delight after a challenging year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kate MacNamara’s article (<b>NZ</b> Herald, August 12) on Three Waters almost completely misses the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her article notes, in passing, that if Three Waters is implemented, regions that have already paid for adequate infrastructure will be forced to fund infrastructure in regions that have underinvested. Where is the debate about cross-subsidisation effects?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farming organisations loathe Three Waters because it requires massive changes to farming practices to reduce water use and run-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it any surprise the most vociferous opposition comes from rural mayors whose districts profit from dairy farming? Is it surprising that those mayors talk about “control” and “ownership” of infrastructure — but with no acknowledgement of the real rural agenda; opposing any environmental water and pollution regulation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I object to Auckland subsidising Northland’s water infrastructure. I do not object to a clean and healthy environment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Christopher Luxon’s initiative to get the young into employment is laudable. However, is his enthusiasm shared by other parties involved?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reserve Bank expresses concern that when unemployment dips below 4 per cent, we have exceeded “maximum sustainable employment”. Employers have got used to importing immigrants rather than spending the money and time to train young Kiwis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem may well be with the older, not the young.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excessive profit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been quite an outcry recently regarding reports of <b>New Zealand</b> supermarkets making supposedly excess profits of one million dollars per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>NZ</b> Herald reported last week that the Australian-owned <span class="companylink">ASB Bank</span> had declared a June year-end net profit of $1.47 billion. By my maths, that is just over four million dollars per day, four times more profit than supermarkets and I have yet to hear any hue and cry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I imagine that when other banks operating in <b>New Zealand</b> announce their end of financial year results, the net profits will no doubt be similarly excessive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both supermarkets and banks are essential services, however New Zealanders deserve better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together with inflation and fuel prices, is it no wonder that the cost of living in <b>New Zealand</b> is out of control?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randal Lockie, Rothesay Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving homeWe have a staffing shortage in critical employment areas. Do we, as Kiwis, stay and help? Not likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It amazes me how Kiwi citizens have such short memories. During 2020-2021 there was a hell of a furore because New Zealanders were unable to get into <b>New Zealand</b> due to border closures, <b>Covid</b> and overcapacity in MIQ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now our borders are open, they want to abandon their native country and fly to work overseas where the monetary return is greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No consideration has been given by those exiting to the billions spent on MIQ facilities, wages for security personnel, transport costs, extra immigration staff funding, free vaccinations, free trade training, free tertiary fees, top-ups from government coffers for doctors, nurses, teachers, and wage subsidies to keep Kiwi families fed and businesses afloat, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greed and money rule. We bite the hand that feeds us and we have very very short memories when it comes to loyalty to our country. A sniff of, and the promise of, more dosh and our experiences of kindness and wellbeing from our leaders just fade away as far distant memories.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unqualified failure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again we are hearing about foreign doctors being given entry but not a path to requalify and be of use to New Zealanders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, an unqualified doctor has got past the “gatekeepers” and has been practising in a hospital for months. The Government is talking about importing doctors from overseas to help with the shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like the stupid muddle we had 25 years ago about overseas qualifications. I was giving English lessons to a Russian heart surgeon who had no pathway in <b>NZ</b> to requalify. His English was pretty good but he thought it might help to be better. Doctors were driving taxis because the Medical Council would not approve or help immigrant doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I went to China to teach I rented my flat to a Romanian professor of engineering and his partner, a lecturer in maths. Both worked as carers in a Torbay rest home because there was little help in requalifying to <b>New Zealand</b> criteria, without doing lots more study again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-five years is a long time for authorities to learn how to make the most of immigrant opportunities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2022, Ports Of Auckland posted a net profit of $23.5 million with volumes up across all cargo types, from which <span class="companylink">Auckland Council</span> was paid a dividend of $2.1m and all Auckland ratepayers benefited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vested interests in the form of avaricious property developers are spreading the myth that Ports of Auckland is losing money simply to get their greedy hands on Auckland’s most valuable strip of land so they can build more of their bland glass towers from which a handful of investors can make huge profits.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just because the majority of children at Dilworth School didn’t endure misconduct from adults around them doesn’t mean many of them weren’t abused by the people who were supposed to care for them and keep them safe.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Chris Hipkins and Willie Jackson to announce they haven’t seen bullying at parliamentary grounds, doesn’t mean the people who have experienced it have no right to express it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember how incensed a Q+A host was when Taika Waititi let the world know that our country is “racist as ... ” The Pope went to Canada recently to apologise to its First Nation’s people for atrocities committed by church-run schools.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walking with parents and/or other groups of children promotes lifestyle habits that help avert later <b>mental health</b> and obesity risks, not to mention reduce our carbon footprints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even allowing for political point-scoring on the tired old law and order card, for someone of Stanford’s position to suggest crime is so pervasive it is safer to drive children to school is irresponsible fear-mongering.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">End Private Healthcare Worker <b>Covid</b> Mandates Now</span>
</div><div class="author"><b>New Zealand</b> Chiropractors' Association </div><div>652 words</div><div>15 August 2022</div><div>11:10</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>New Zealand</b> Chiropractors' Association (NZCA) is again calling for the government to end <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> mandates for private primary healthcare practices, as the continuing restrictions are unjust and unsubstantiated now that the Omicron variant is at large in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NZCA executive has repeatedly written to the Ministry of Health, the Chief of Allied Health, as well as issued multiple press releases this year as further data has emerged regarding the transmission and the ability to contract new variants across all populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The peak body for chiropractic in <b>New Zealand</b> says that private primary health providers, such as chiropractors, rely on face-to-face consultations and fee-based income to survive. Prolonged restrictions on the delivery of healthcare are critically affecting the viability of many small businesses and leaving thousands of New Zealanders without an option for healthcare in their communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NZCA spokesperson Dr Cassandra Fairest, chiropractor, says "We have a significant number of chiropractors affected by the mandate. This is putting unnecessary stress on the health system and disrupting the provision of healthcare in our communities. The hospitals are overrun and have enormous wait times. We need all available allied healthcare professionals caring for people and keeping them out of the hospital system'.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing healthcare <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> vaccination mandate is affecting numerous healthcare professions, leading to significant shortages to a healthcare workforce that was already stretched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This issue was highlighted in the NZIER-commissioned (<b>New Zealand</b> Institute of Economic Research) Allied Health Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b> 2019 "Hidden in Plain Sight'' report (https://www.nzchiropractors.org/chiropractic-links/hidden-in-plain-sight/[https://www.nzchiropractors.org/chiropractic-links/hidden-in-plain-sight/]) about the over-reliance on GP's, nurses and the secondary health system and the under-utilisation of services such as chiropractors and allied health professions who could alleviate pressure at the bottom of the cliff by providing the fence at the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allied health practitioners represent a ready-workforce able to support a shift to more effective and more proactive prevention, person-centred care, and collaborative, interdisciplinary team-based approaches that are most appropriate for people with complex health issues including long-term conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With experience working in multi-disciplinary teams and across the secondary and primary care sectors, many allied health practitioners are also uniquely experienced in supporting patient transitions between settings of care, a critical strength that can support greater coordination and continuity in patient journeys.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Cassandra Fairest says: "Chiropractors are highly trained healthcare professionals and are able to undertake infection prevention and control strategies. We have relatively short appointment times, easy contact traceability and the ability to screen our patients for infection risk. Certainly, we pose no greater risk of infection transmission than teachers or hairdressers who have had their mandates lifted. We see that the ACT and National parties, nurses and midwives are also all calling for an end to these mandates, and we fully support this.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chiropractors are regulated primary health care professionals registered under the HPCA Act with close to 700 annual practising certificate holders practising in solo, group, and multidisciplinary clinics around <b>New Zealand</b>. <b>New Zealand</b> chiropractors have significant training (a minimum 5-year tertiary degree) and a broad yet highly skilled scope of practice and clinical expertise. They provide care for the public in a wide range of health concerns, including spinal problems, posture, certain neurological issues and chronic pain. Importantly, particularly with the heightened levels of <b>mental health</b> concerns being seen this year, chiropractors help many people with anxiety, sleeping difficulties and stress related disorders through their ability to assist the nervous system.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>'s chiropractors are taking the lead to inform and inspire people to improve their health and prevent pain and disability by educating the public to have a greater understanding of the relationship between their spine and nervous system and how this affects their function and overall well-being.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eddie Osei-Nketia - <b>New Zealand</b>'s fastest man - speaks of his pain watching from home, as slower sprinters raced for medals in Birmingham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--------------------</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurt and disillusioned, the fastest man to ever run for <b>New Zealand</b> is contemplating what next after missing out on selection for the Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eddie Osei-Nketia broke his dad Gus's national 100m record at the world athletics championships in Oregon in July, but it was too late to make the <b>NZ</b> team for the Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many argue he should have been selected for Birmingham before then, and that qualifying times set by Athletics <b>New Zealand</b> - based on the NZOC's criteria of top 6 capability - are unreasonable, especially when it comes to the glamour track events that have considerably more depth than some field events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 21-year-old told Stuff from his base in Canberra that it was a "hurtful experience seeing people who are slower than you compete while you're watching on TV".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's crazy, I ran a national record, and the Commonwealth Games has less people competing compared to the world championship. I felt like I should've at least had the opportunity to run, as well as Tiaan Whelpton, Georgia Hulls and Rosie Elliott. So many young athletes that deserve to go. How come I didn't get a chance to expand on those experiences from worlds and make me better for other games?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osei-Nketia needed at least two B-standard qualifying times but only posted one (10.12sec) before the cut-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His 10.08 <b>New Zealand</b> record at the world championships was too late (interestingly, that time would have won silver in the men's 100m at the past six Commonwealth Games), though former <b>New Zealand</b> marathon runner Tony Payne, who now races for Thailand, said other countries had much later selection deadlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The <b>New Zealand</b> deadline was May 1, where <b>Australia</b> for example was June 12. This didn't allow <b>NZ</b> athletes to compete in the Europe summer season to obtain standards. This was completely unfair, especially during a <b>pandemic</b> when New Zealanders were not allowed to leave <b>NZ</b> and return freely during the <b>quarantine</b> period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In addition, you want an athlete to be peaking at the championship, not months beforehand. The deadline makes zero sense from a performance perspective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it transpired, <b>New Zealand</b> took only 17 athletes to Birmingham when their quota was 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It feels like they're not even putting in the effort to fill those spots; in fact it feels like they are gate-keeping and only taking medal chances, but then if you look at some selections they are not medal chances," said Whelpton, the <b>New Zealand</b> resident record holder over 100m who ran a wind-assisted 10.09 over summer but has since struggled with a hamstring injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a bit silly really, it's already hard enough as it is, especially in an event like the 100m."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osei-Nketia - like his coach Gary Henley-Smith - just wants what he feels are "reasonable qualifying standards". "It feels like instead of being open-minded and taking all the factors into account, they're just shutting us down and looking only at numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Osei-Nketia and Whelpton say tough qualifying times are fine, but there is no allowance for factors such as the conditions they race in or competition they race against in <b>New Zealand</b>, or the likely level of competition at meets such as the Commonwealth Games being significantly reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those A and B qualifying times, you can get those times in Diamond League meets in Europe and America but it's so hard to get those times in <b>New Zealand</b>," said Osei- Nketia, who beat Ferdinand Omanyala during the heats at the world championships then watched as the Kenyan went onto win the Commonwealth gold medal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whelpton, himself only 22, added: "I agree that wearing that singlet is an honour that should be earned, but we're not asking for handouts, we simply want fairness. If there's athletes that are good enough to be there, they should be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Whelpton notes, it's a chicken and egg scenario. Big performances come at big meets. However, they can't get selected to go to those big meets, because they're not posting the tough qualifying times in trying home conditions. If they attended these big meets, they'd likely go much quicker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case in point is Osei-Nketia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Up until the world champs in Eugene, Eddie's season best was a 10.19 yet he managed to smash that over there," Whelpton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The effects of our tough conditions are never taken into consideration. For example, earlier this year I ran 10.43 into a massive headwind, and two weeks later I ran 10.09 with a tail wind that was over the limit. In the entire domestic season only one of my races had a legal tailwind, and in that race I ran the resident record."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not wanting preferential treatment, Osei-Nketia and Whelpton believe the depth and prestige of an event should be factored into qualifying criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 10 heats for the men's 100m in Birmingham, more than 70 starters, compared to, say, the women's javelin, where there were eight - much easier to gain a top-6 finish. "It's a bit silly really, it's already hard enough as it is, especially in an event like the 100m, which has by far the most depth," said Whelpton, who felt it was senseless that top-6 finishes were equally valued across all events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payne added: "Eddie would be hyped as a medal contender. He should have been at Tokyo 2020, and he should have been in Birmingham 2022. The nation would have stopped to watch him run for a historic Commonwealth Games medal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whelpton said Zoe Hobbs "did a great job proving how inspiring it can be for young athletes".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hobbs, who finished sixth in the women's 100m final in Birmingham, was selected for the Games after only posting one B-standard (11.15sec in Hastings in February), but "extenuating circumstances" - world-class 60m indoor times and a windy 11.07sec at nationals - were deemed enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She did not disappoint, reaching the final and coming within 0.01 sec of her Oceania record (11.08sec) in her heat a week after being struck down with <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite "only" finishing sixth, stories about Hobbs were among the most read Games content on Stuff, more so than some medal-winning performances in other sports or athletic events, highlighting the huge interest and appeal in 100m sprinting among the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The 100m is the cream of the crop in the athletics world," said Whelpton. "It's the highlight event, the most watched and the most talked about. Naturally this means it's also the most competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Imagine how cool it would've been to see both male and female Kiwis in the 100m finals, imagine how many children would be inspired, how many people would be talking about it. Almost every Commonwealth country featured in the men's 100m except <b>New Zealand</b>, and it's not that we don't have good sprinters, they just weren't sent, and that's a shame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the NZOC seems to care about is medals, but does this reflect what is truly important? And does this reflect what the public cares about? The public might have an entirely different perception of what they consider to be successful compared to the NZOC. The sport is about athletes, not medals. It's the athletes they should be fighting for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payne said the qualifying standards are flawed and make "no sense".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"ANZ say the standards are based on 'statistics', however, they are based on the world rankings and with the built-in false premise that everyone will show up to the games. Many top athletes do not. So the standards in events that are truly competitive are far too hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Another example is the 10,000m and the marathon, top athletes do not compete. However, the <b>New Zealand</b> A standard for both events is faster than the <b>New Zealand</b> record and for the marathon the Commonwealth Games record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yet we do not send our sprinters [or other athletes in stronger events such as the 800m or the marathon]. We choose to send the athletes in weaker events, where top six is far more attainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we send James Preston and Brad Mathas, <b>New Zealand</b> likely has two athletes in the 800m final."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He agrees the best times are set at the big meets but <b>New Zealand</b>'s top sprinters can't get to them. When they do, like Osei-Nketia and Hobbs have, they shine. But the system is geared toward them not getting to these events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The heart of the problem lies with the NZOC," Payne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Top six should not apply to the 100m, 1500m etc. Selections are biased towards sports no-one does. To be frank, the walk and throws, bowls, 3x3 basketball, etc. On this basis, should the All Whites bother going to the World Cup? They will never finish top six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Top 16 [or top six] should not apply for sports that people participate in on a global scale. See the woods from the trees NZOC - and please, Athletics <b>New Zealand</b>, fight for our athletes to change the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A blanket top 16 [Olympics] or top six [Commonwealth Games] selection policy across all sports is weak. Top 16, top six standards should also not be applied within track and field itself too. There should be exercisable discretion towards the harder events. No offence to those who participate in throws, walks etc but the 100m is way harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let's not forget, <span class="companylink">World Athletics</span> invited both Hobbs and Osei-Nketia to compete at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics in the 100m. One of the most watched sporting events on the planet. Those invitations were thrown into the rubbish bin and both are not Olympians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Income and endorsement deals lost. Imagine what that does to your <b>mental health</b>? I personally know people who have quit the sport, or suffered depression from the ruthlessness of the standards set by Athletics <b>NZ</b> and the NZOC."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2022 round of the Rainbow Wellbeing Legacy Fund (RWLF) will see $299,999 in grants being distributed to programmes with a focus on <b>mental health</b> in rainbow communities thanks to a partnership with Foundation North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foundation North, the community trust for Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland and Te Tai Tokerau Northland, has made a contribution of $99,999 to the 2022 round of the RWLF. Administered by the Rule Foundation, the RWLF was established in 2019 in recognition of the men who were convicted for consensual homosexual activities pre-1986. The Rule Foundation approached Foundation North to increase the funding available to a long under-resourced community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our rainbow communities continue to be over represented in negative health and wellbeing statistics. The most recent HES (Household Economic Survey) from Stats <b>NZ</b> showed LGBT+ people as 1.6 times more likely to experience anxiety and depression, rising to 2-3 times for those aged 18-29" says Duncan Matthews, Chair of the Rule Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grants will be allocated to activities that support Rainbow <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing, such as resource development, community events, digital or online initiatives, information sharing initiatives and campaigns, and training. Projects that respond to the impacts of <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> on rainbow communities are encouraged, as well as projects that acknowledge and support those within the Rainbow community that experience multiple forms of oppression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're really excited to be partnering with Foundation North to fund projects that make a difference in the lives of rainbow communities and their whānau" says Matthews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the Rule Foundation's focus being entirely on funding rainbow communities, this top-up is set to support more grass roots community initiatives, particularly those that don't have such established networks and organisations. A huge thank you to Foundation North for enabling our community in this way!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are pleased to contribute towards the Rainbow Wellness Legacy Fund," says Audry McLaren, Funding Manager at Foundation North. "This co-funding partnership will extend the reach of our support for LGBTQI+ communities in Tāmaki Makaurau and Te Tai Tokerau."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondary teachers are calling on the Government to invest in young people and Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b> as they launch a campaign today in support of their collective agreement negotiations, which began formally in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ensuring that rangatahi have the knowledge, skills, agility and resilience they need is at the heart of Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>'s <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> recovery and its future. It's a hugely exciting and demanding ask. Teachers need to be well supported and rewarded - invest in teachers, invest in Aotearoa," says Melanie Webber, PPTA Te Wehengarua President.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melanie Webber says one way the Government can invest in secondary education is by ensuring that salaries and working conditions can attract top graduates into the profession and keep existing teachers there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PPTA's latest survey of secondary teacher supply shows how increasingly difficult it is becoming for schools to find suitable staff. The May survey was based on responses from principals of almost 25 per cent of secondary and composite schools around <b>New Zealand</b>. Key findings of the survey are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost a third of schools that responded to the survey had teachers working in areas in which they were not specialised, predominantly Te Reo Māori, Maths and Technology, because specialists could not be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a quarter of schools were forced to cancel or transfer classes to Te Kura (Correspondence School), polytechnics or online because specialist teachers could not be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Secondary education has a huge impact on young people's life chances. Every rangatahi has a right to specialist teachers in every subject."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well as claiming for a pay increase in line with the cost of living, PPTA is claiming for extra staffing for pastoral care in secondary schools, including more guidance counsellors. "An increasing number of ākonga are experiencing a range of <b>mental health</b> and personal issues; more specially trained and skilled staff are desperately needed to work with these students and their families."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PPTA is also seeking to improve Māori and Pasifika student engagement by creating new community liaison roles and is claiming greater recognition for teachers expert in Māori language and culture but who do not teach at a Māori immersion school. PPTA is also claiming more time for teachers to undertake professional development. "In order to equip our rangatahi with the knowledge and skills they need for their future, teachers need to be at the cutting edge of our subject areas and teaching practice."</p>

                           Health <b>NZ</b> Urged To Adopt New Telehealth Model To Alleviate Workforce Crisis</span>
</div><div class="author">NZTF </div><div>653 words</div><div>10 August 2022</div><div>06:08</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are calls for the government to adopt a newly proposed, cloud-based, national telehealth programme to help offset the currrent health workforce crisis, reduce burnout and eliminate decades-long inequities in patient care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called PASE - the Patient Anywhere Specialist Everywhere project - the system is a centralised telehealth model of care with a nationwide rostering system for specialist doctors, GPs, nurses and health workers, delivering timely care to patients no matter where they live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brainchild of the <b>New Zealand</b> Telehealth Forum (NZTF), a White Paper outlining the PASE model of care has been presented to MPs and leading health officials from both <span class="companylink">Health <b>NZ</b></span> (Te Whatu Ora) and the <span class="companylink">Maori Health Authority</span> (Te Aka Whai Ora) in the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept relies on a national employer, national booking system and shared health record - a cloud-based, multispecialty health service provider, not reliant on bricks and mortar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"PASE could help solve elements of the chronic health workforce shortage in Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>," says NZTF Chair and Rural Hospital and ED specialist Dr Ruth Large. "Now that we have a new, centralised health system with <span class="companylink">Health <b>NZ</b></span> and the <span class="companylink">Māori Health Authority</span>, national solutions to nationwide problems such as the PASE model of care can make a real difference to the lives of health professionals, patients and their whānau."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Large says PASE would be cost-effective to set up, train staff to use and then ultimately run, providing a "win-win' for both health professionals and patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would immediately reduce patient travel time and expense by providing care straight to the patient's home or local healthcare facility no matter where they live. It would reduce inequities of access, reduce waiting times for diagnosis, decrease the risk of misdiagnosis and also meet cultural and disability needs, allowing whānau to be able to speak with a specialist and in-person clinician at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Health professionals would receive better collegial, clinical support, especially those working in rural and provincial centres, with PASE providing twenty-four-seven access to a full network of health specialities, helping better manage and coordinate care for patients. While not a panacea for all specialist workforce shortages, PASE would enable more spread of existing services, supporting clinicians to access professional development, continue to work where they live and enable colleagues to work at the top of their scope with specialist support," says Dr Large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PASE model is similar to systems used in other <span class="companylink">OECD</span> health systems overseas - for the management of hypertentsion, stroke, adult and paediatric emergencies, hospice care, chronic conditions such as asthma, arthritis and congestive heart failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> Telehealth Leadership Group member Andrew Panckhurst says pilot telehealth projects carried out across Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b> have shown the IT technology and know-how already exist to roll PASE out successfully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The PASE model would be an excellent fit for Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>, being and relatively simple to set up, train clinicians to use and implement, supporting not just gaps in medical care, but <b>mental health</b> care, palliative and cancer care, even speech therapy and optometry as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We now have the prospect of a further potential health crisis looming in the form of Long <b>Covid</b>, which requires multiple pathological processes and specialty treatment. A PASE system would allow patients anywhere and everywhere to receive the required levels of multi-disciplinary specialist care they need," says Panckhurst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NZTF says a business case is now needed to determine the exact costs and IT infrastructure required to get a PASE system up and running here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Its vital that both <span class="companylink">Health <b>NZ</b></span> and the <span class="companylink">Māori Health Authority</span> take a full systems view when considering a a national telehealth care model in order to avoid potential inequities. The true strength of PASE will be seen in a whole of system, whānau, patient implementation approach."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National's new unemployment policy is too simplistic an approach to work on such a complex and complicated issue, says the <b>NZ</b> Association of Counsellors (NZAC).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly elected president Sarah Maindonald says a simple carrot and stick approach as National is proposing won't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says long-term unemployment of the type National is trying to address is often rooted in deep-seated issues that arise much earlier in a person's life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms Maindonald says 21 per cent of young people identified in the <span class="companylink">University of Auckland</span>'s regular Youth Health Survey suffer significant psychological distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those young people are struggling with homelessness, <b>mental health</b> and addiction challenges, and they need robust physical and <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing interventions," Ms Maindonald says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says a more valuable, but longer-term policy, would be to put in place better preventative supports targeting the teenage years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Education commissioned research in 2020 to gauge the effectiveness of school counselling in this space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research confirmed counselling is an effective intervention for young people who are struggling with <b>mental wellbeing</b> issues that might impact their ability later to gain productive and ongoing work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But there's been very little tagged funding invested in this area to increase counselling staffing in schools," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some cases you've got bigger schools with one counsellor servicing over 1,000 students and that's just untenable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the same time, the issues that some of these young people are presenting with are getting increasingly complex and severe, and they can have life-long impacts unless they are addressed at an early age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our young people these days are often struggling with ongoing family violence, family separation, grief and loss issues, bullying, drug and alcohol issues and, of course, the <b>mental health</b> issues and anxiety generated by <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We shouldn't try and downplay the impacts on these young people and we can't afford to write them off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So, yes, we do need sensible policies to address unemployment issues - that's the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But let's also have policies in place that provide a fence at the top of that cliff, and investing properly in youth <b>mental health</b> would be a great start."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Euthanasia Or Palliative Care?</span>
</div><div class="author">New Conservative </div><div>567 words</div><div>8 August 2022</div><div>06:43</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of New Conservative's core principles is a commitment to the sanctity of life. We believe human life is sacred, from conception to natural death. These principles are not held by the ruling Labour/Greens coalition; neither are they held by National or Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Conservative opposes the recent changes to both our abortion and euthanasia laws and we stand firmly against all intentional attacks on innocent human life. The majority of MPs in parliament have supported laws that attack human life at both ends of the spectrum. National's Christopher Luxon has made it clear that, if his party gets to govern, he does not intend to make any changes to our abortion or euthanasia laws. Act's David Seymour is the author and promoter of the 2019 End of Life Choice Act. Seymour was forced to accept stricter grounds of eligibility than he wanted, to ensure his euthanasia bill got through Parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 7th November 2021 when the Act came into force and 30th June 2022, 146 people have been legally killed in <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that Euthanasia has been legalised in <b>New Zealand</b>, New Conservative is concerned that our country will follow the trend seen in other countries which has let euthanasia out of the box. In these countries we see an ever-increasing number of people being euthanised and continual expansion of the grounds under which it is permitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Euthanasia statistics for 2021, for example, reveal that over 10,000 persons were euthanised in that country, representing nearly 3.5% of all deaths. Of these at least 1740 were euthanised citing reasons including loneliness and <b>isolation</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To those who would dismiss concerns about euthanasia contagion, we point out that while euthanasia started off in countries like the Netherlands strictly for terminal conditions, we now see those with dementia being euthanised, and even those with <b>mental health</b> issues. Babies are being euthanised, and a recent push by their health minister called for euthanasia to be made available for children under 12 years old. This of course all paves the way for euthanasia to move from voluntary to non-voluntary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Conservative believes that the passing of the End of Life Choice Act 2019, marked a very ominous breach in our country's long standing opposition to doctors killing their patients, as exemplified by their swearing the Hippocratic Oath. Our medical profession, until recently, has followed a tradition of honouring a commitment to the principle of "First do no harm."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does the push for ever widening grounds of eligibility end? With our health system already under great pressure, the temptation to accede to demands for wider accessibility is a real possibility, as some politicians look for ways to cut health spending. There is a glaring discrepancy in the real problems our hospices face with insufficient government funding, and the up to $3000 fees that may be claimed for killing a patient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Conservative believes euthanasia will remain a serious threat to the terminally ill and seriously disabled, unless the Abortion Legislation Act and the End of Life Choice Act are challenged. We believe action needs to be taken to increase public funding for our underfunded hospices and for better end-of-life care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Conservative remains committed to pursuing policies which both uphold the sanctity of life and increase funding for palliative care.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arts are not taught sustainably in <b>New Zealand</b> schools or in teacher training, experts say, despite research showing that children in arts-rich schools do significantly better at the basics than at schools that focus on measuring literacy and numeracy outcomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures from Education Counts show the number of secondary students enrolled in arts subjects has dropped from 222,427 young Kiwis in 2007 to 162,961 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music has "nearly died", despite once being a vital and key part of learning; dance and drama have been "marginalised or trivialised" and excluded from the curriculum; and visual arts, which once dominated the arts, is also declining in schools, according to Peter O'Connor, a professor and director of the University of Auckland's Centre for Arts and Social Transformation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teaching students are only given about 14 hours of contact time for arts education when studying towards their degree, said Emma Bishop, the co-chairperson of Whirimanga, the Arts Education Alliance of Aotearoa. "How can anyone learn how to teach music in that amount of time?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's arts curriculum was out of date, Bishop said, and the Ministry of Education's historical decision to axe national subject advisers has left it up to underfunded volunteer-run subject associations to ensure quality arts teaching professional development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was increasingly difficult to get "already over-run" teachers to give up more of their personal time to up-skill themselves. And there was great variation with the quality of arts education in schools, Bishop said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual teachers who were passionate about the arts may be able to provide students with education opportunities, and private schools were more likely to be able to invest in arts education. In most primary schools, Bishop said the arts were relegated to the "pretty little thing on a Friday afternoon".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research shows innumerable benefits of the arts to a range of diverse learners. Arts subjects were wrongly tarred as "specialist" subjects because of a heavy, ill-placed focus in schools on academic rigour, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Education had lost sight of the STEAM model, which incorporated the arts into children's learning alongside science, technology, engineering and mathematics. There were also no arts specialists at the ministry's executive level, Bishop said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O'Connor said there needed to be improved teacher education so those who wanted to teach the arts, could. The ministry also needed to develop resources to support more teaching of the arts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tragedy is that at several points we led the world in arts education. Now we languish at the bottom," O'Connor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national curriculum's focus needed to shift from literacy and numeracy to a "broad, rich and varied curriculum so that children want to come to school again", he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> is in the midst of a truancy crisis, with skyrocketing absenteeism exacerbated by rising poverty and the spread of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drama <b>New Zealand</b> president Annette Thomson said the arts had <b>mental health</b> benefits and could build resilience in students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry of Education spokeswoman Pauline Cleaver said it was committed to supporting children to engage with the arts, and support teachers to deliver arts learning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools have flexibility to deliver their own local curriculums based off the <b>New Zealand</b> Curriculum, meaning schools could provide arts education to meet the needs and interests of their students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Creatives in Schools initiative, a partnership between the Ministry of Education, Ministry for Culture and Heritage and <span class="companylink">Creative <b>New Zealand</b></span>, helped build teachers' confidence to lead arts education alongside professional creatives, Cleaver said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the education ministry has funded 352 projects through Creatives in Schools since 2020, and it would be able to fund up to 200 more projects next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arts curriculum would be reviewed next year as part of a wider <b>New Zealand</b> Curriculum refresh.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of National Party members have descended on Christchurch for the party's annual national conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference, the significant political and social fixture on the calendar of party members, will be held at the Te Pae Christchurch Convention Centre, a post-earthquake building that was conceived when the previous National Government held office. It opened its doors to the first conference in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is Christopher Luxon's first National conference as leader of the party. He has restored National's fortunes in the polls, polling in the high 30s or early 40s in most public polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 650 party members are expected to attend the conference, which runs over today and tomorrow, and culminates in a keynote address by Luxon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference turnout is higher than the party expected, given that the election is still more than a year away. Numerous sources said that the prospect of the party winning seems to have galvanised support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, the settling of the party's leadership struggles and an easing in <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> restrictions have encouraged the strong turnout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference itself runs in a similar manner to most conferences, with a mixture of keynote speeches, panel sessions and closed sessions for conducting party business, including the annual general meeting and a session on next year's election campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will also mark long-term president Peter Goodfellow's final address to the party. <span class="companylink">Goodfellow</span> announced his intention to retire in June after 13 years as party president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new party president will be announced tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under National Party rules the new president will be elected by the board, not the membership-at-large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Goodfellow</span> was re-elected at the previous annual conference a year ago prompting former Speaker David Carter, who also ran for the position, to resign from the party board saying he had "zero confidence" in Goodfellow's leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to speeches by <span class="companylink">Goodfellow</span>, party finance spokesperson Nicola Willis (today) and Luxon (tomorrow), there will be various sessions on policies the party is working up, including the economy, law and order, <b>mental health</b> and regional <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Willis's speech is expected to be a sweeping economic address going back into the party's history and laying out its first principles on economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National has been relentlessly pursuing the Government over the high inflation rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various remits from party members and groups will also be heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the party ran its candidate college for prospective new candidates and the Young Nationals threw a fundraiser party in the evening. There is a busy informal calendar of social events that have popped up around the conference.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaze blazed his way around eight laps of the course in 1hr 34:19 - giving him the win by 31 seconds from Oliver, who had a 1:31 buffer over bronze medallist Alexander Miller of Namibia - after declaring pre-race he would compete for <b>mental health</b> awareness and donate his skin suit to the Sir John Kirwan Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to make an impact rather than just ride my bike fast," Gaze said. "Sportspeople are just people who have found their talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But if we can make an impact in things we believe in, things that can actually serve the country a good cause then it makes me happy doing it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 26-year-old has had depression in recent years, partly sparked by his victory in the same event at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, when his gold medal triumph over team-mate Cooper was highlighted by Gaze giving Cooper the finger as Cooper rode past him heading into the last lap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaze had entered the pits to fix a puncture on his rear tyre and Cooper attacked immediately, but Gaze chased him down before accusing Cooper of bad sportsmanship soon after hopping off his bike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaze later apologised for his response, was fined <b>NZ</b>$282 by cycling's governing body and later said if he had his time again he would "completely change my post-race interview".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just athletes - we're human after all. Everyone is exactly the same in this world," Gaze said after completing back-to- back golds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My identity [was] maybe attached a bit too much to the sportsperson. I had to try and separate those things over the past four years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he didn't blame people of being "upset and mad" after fiery post-race comments in 2018, he said it had also been a difficult period of his career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I didn't uphold that responsibility [of representing his country] the best I could have. But of course, it has been hard; it is never nice to have death threats sent to you," he said post-Gold Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his win in the Midlands, Gaze reflected on the impact of that event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a lot more proud of this version of myself coming back four years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've a greater sense of self, and the person in me is I like to think a lot-more well- rounded and a better athlete for it. In a weird way I don't regret what happened four years ago because it shaped me into who I am today."</p>

</div><div class="author"><b>New Zealand</b> Carers Alliance </div><div>759 words</div><div>5 August 2022</div><div>10:04</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>'s 1m+ family carers are doing it tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the face of <b>pandemic</b> worker shortages and service disruptions, those supporting family members who are unwell or have a disability or chronic health condition are experiencing significant hardship - and they're not getting enough help to keep going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National charity Carers <b>NZ</b> and the Carers Alliance of more than 50 not for profits have released a report from independent analytics company Synergia based on 1,648 survey responses from carers of all ages and ethnicities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carers spent an hour on average completing the 70 question survey about their wellbeing, finances, and views about available support for their role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The results are shocking," says Alliance Secretariat and Carers <b>NZ</b> CEO Laurie Hilsgen. "People can't keep going like this without support themselves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The State of Caring survey will be repeated every two years to track how family whanau and aiga carers are faring over time. The first report for 2022 shows that only 2% of carers feel valued by the Government despite their</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">largely unpaid work having (according to Infometrics) an annual economic value of at least $16.8 billion - 5.1% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report shows that 59% of carers are struggling to pay their bills, that 70% experience depression or anxiety, that only 21% can work full-time, and that only 7% have been able to look ahead to save for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilsgen says it's concerning that almost 90% of carers have had less or much less respite from caring since before the <b>pandemic</b>, a wellbeing risk for New Zealanders providing high needs care for a vulnerable family member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issues hit women especially hard - two thirds of <b>New Zealand</b>'s family carers are women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey shows that young carers under 35 have the lowest physical and <b>mental wellbeing</b> but contribute the most towards care-related costs that are not publicly funded ($100 per week or more).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Synergia estimates that care related out of pocket costs total at least $335 million a year for the wider population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the grim picture, successive governments haven't tackled the big issues for carers because they will take the most effort and cost the most, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've made 12 recommendations asking for authentic, urgent, long-term investment in carers. Our country's respite system is broken and under-funded, so people can't have adequate breaks. Not many carers can get paid for their role even though they may have given up paid work to care. A choice to care and help someone in our family is a choice to be poor, and to experience unacceptable wellbeing impacts that are affecting high numbers of New Zealanders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bright spot in the survey is that working carers say their employers have been flexible and supportive through <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> despite business hardships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While family carers have had scant government recognition during the <b>pandemic</b>, their mahi aroha is carrying the most vulnerable through <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every family carer is a legend. We can't ask more of them than they are already giving. Now we face a long tail of hardship and a need for better support, new respite funding and services, and Ministerial leadership to ensure agencies focus on carers as an urgent priority."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says there is so much chaos and system change that only government leadership will achieve agency cut through to sustain carers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carers <b>NZ</b> and the Carers Alliance wrote to Carmel Sepuloni, the Minister for Social Development, and Health Minister Andrew Little, last December urging them to lead a sustainability plan for carers in the face of the approaching omicron wave. Despite the Ministers' supportive response, at a government agency level little has been done in vital areas like facility-based respite, Hilsgen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a country we haven't asked carers how they are. We haven't asked what more they need as the last line of defence for people with high support needs. Services are faltering because of the severe worker shortage. This means more pressure on family carers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Ministers have to lead. The not for profits are doing their best but the meaningful help and leadership needs to come from the Government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The creep of expectation that carers can do more and more, with inadequate support, doesn't match the rising costs, tiredness, and real life demands families are experiencing."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>'s largest locally owned life insurer Fidelity Life has announced its sponsorship of two local not-for-profit organisations, Outward Bound and Bellyful, to help bolster the charities' respective operations and give back to New Zealanders in a meaningful way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based in Anakiwa in the Marlborough Sounds, Outward Bound helps people realise their potential through learned experiences of challenge, success and self-reflection, commonly utilising the outdoors and its elements to teach key life skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellyful is a growing, nationwide volunteer-driven charity, which nourishes and connects communities by cooking and delivering free meals to families with babies or young children who need support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Fidelity</span> Life Chief Executive Officer Melissa Cantell says the two charities were chosen based on their alignment to Fidelity Life's brand and its purpose in making a tangible difference to New Zealanders today, and for future generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a proud <b>New Zealand</b> business, our brand is deeply rooted in the land, the people and our connection to nature. That gives us a sense of responsibility to protect what we're proud of and ensure we're contributing towards improving our society for all New Zealanders in a meaningful way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's why finding the right sponsorship fit is so important to us. Outward Bound and Bellyful were handpicked as we knew we could make a real impact, together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fidelity Life's sponsorship of Outward Bound features scholarships to enable 20 diverse young New Zealanders to complete a 21-day course at Anakiwa per year. They'll develop lifelong skills to give back to their communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, each year Fidelity Life will offer a group of advisers the opportunity to realise their potential by supporting them on a 5-day Outward Bound Professional course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fidelity Life will also launch a special programme for its people to attend an Outward Bound course to help grow and nurture future leadership talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Stepping outside our comfort zone is often where we learn and grow the most. We can't wait to see our scholarship recipients, our adviser partners and our people harness their Outward Bound experiences and build transferable skills and attitudes to take back to work, study and home, for life," says Melissa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outward Bound Chief Executive Officer Malindi MacLean says the synergy the charity has found with Fidelity Life is something special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being supported by organisations that understand the value of what we do and how it's applied to the real world is important - and that's what we've found in Fidelity Life. The sponsorship will make a tangible difference to the lives of the young New Zealanders who receive the Fidelity Life scholarships, and we know they will go on to positively contribute to their communities across <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing many of our youth struggling with their <b>mental health</b>, including dealing with the ongoing uncertainty from <b>Covid</b>, so providing an opportunity to equip them with skills to look after their wellbeing and build resilience is more important than ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Bellyful, Fidelity Life's sponsorship will help scale and expand its operations to reach more families with young children who need support. This includes hosting Cookathons and food drives to help source ingredients and prepare meals, as well as tapping into Fidelity Life's networks to promote and increase awareness of Bellyful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellyful General Manager Wendy Thompson says: "We're grateful to have Fidelity Life's support, especially as demand for our service is rapidly growing. As we deal with the ongoing fallout from the <b>pandemic</b> and our cost of living continues to rise, more families will be under pressure and facing new challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A little help at the right time can have a huge impact on the families we support and can often have a flow-on effect for future generations. With the contribution from Fidelity Life, we take comfort in knowing we can now be there for a greater number of parents who don't have a "village' to help raise their family."</p>

</div><div class="author">Ryman Healthcare </div><div>809 words</div><div>2 August 2022</div><div>13:47</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryman's Lynfield construction site leads the way on <b>mental health</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray Halberg construction site has become the first <span class="companylink">Ryman Healthcare</span> site to achieve Mates in Construction accreditation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The milestone achievement is proof that the Lynfield team means business when it comes to striving towards good <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing on site, in an industry where suicide rates are shockingly high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the hopes are that other Ryman sites will quickly follow suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Sendall, Field Officer for Mates in Construction, presented the accreditation certificate to the Murray Halberg team, and praised them for their efforts in embracing the programme at a time when stress levels were at record levels in the construction industry as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were 607 suicides in <b>New Zealand</b> last year and in our industry it's about one person every week," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're actually six times more likely to lose someone to suicide than a workplace accident."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>pandemic</b> had compounded the various stressors that affected construction, with supply and labour shortages adding to the pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young men aged 20-24 were typically the most at risk, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a time when they might be leaving home for the first time and going flatting, they're organising their own finances, there could be a relationship breakdown or maybe they're getting bullied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's actually the number one in terms of pressures, especially when you're young and then you get shouted at when at work and that old school attitude where it's just "get the job done'."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mates in Construction is a preventative programme which originated in <b>Australia</b> in 2008, following the Global Financial Crisis. It launched in <b>New Zealand</b> in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Ryman Healthcare</span> partnered with the not-for-profit organisation in November 2020 in a bid to raise awareness around suicide prevention and to encourage people to check in on their fellow workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray Halberg Wellbeing Coordinator James Earls used to be a field officer for Mates in Construction so was perfectly placed to lead the team through the accreditation process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He encouraged other sites to do the same, saying accreditation was a way of formalising their commitment to having processes in place should someone on site find themselves in need of help - or wanting to help a colleague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's more than just putting up signs and flying the Mates flag," said James (Earls).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's about encouraging people to feel comfortable talking about themselves and changing the perception that you're being weak if you're struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to educate people of the need to be open and support each other, and if you see your mate struggling, to empower you to ask that hard question - are you thinking about suicide?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "You don't need to solve the problem, but you know there are people on site to go to for help."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These people are known as Connectors, who link up the person with someone who is ASIST trained, which stands for Applied Suicide Intervention and Skills Training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a site is accredited it means 80% of the team must have received general awareness training at all times and there should be a ratio of 1 Connector per 20 workers. The site should also provide access to someone who is ASIST trained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James (Sendall) said: "It's about being that available resource before things happen, the fence at the top, and helping others to know what it looks like when someone is struggling, and not just saying "harden up and move on.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing team members well enough to spot changes in behaviour was key, he said, referring to these changes as "invitations'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're inviting you in. And if you take that 10 seconds of courage to step into that person's world and ask "are you okay?' it can make a world of difference."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two connectors at Murray Halberg were Health &amp; Safety Coordinator Denise Chandler and Hammerhand Feiloeua "Tiny' Tuipulotu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outgoing Project Manager Dale Sadler praised the team for being "part of the solution'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This accreditation really demonstrates the intent and desire of all the workers on the Murray Halberg site to better understand the impacts and signs of life stresses which we all experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Be they at work, at home or in whichever sector of our lives, these workers have all considerately put themselves in a position to assist in identifying any possible issues and becoming part of a solution to help out their Mates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natalie Finn, <span class="companylink">Ryman Healthcare</span>'s HR Manager Construction, agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a fantastic achievement for the Murray Halberg team, and is recognition for their hard work promoting Mates and encouraging people to have these important conversations on site," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're looking forward to seeing our other sites becoming accredited in the future."</p>

</div><div class="author">Alex Spence analysis </div><div>1232 words</div><div>1 August 2022</div><div>The New Zealand Herald</div><div>NZHLD</div><div>A007</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022 NZME Publishing Ltd. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Essential skills and expertise lost as 1778 nurses leave sector in two years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It had been another tough shift at the adolescent inpatient psychiatric unit in Porirua, where chronic understaffing had made caring for acutely mentally ill teenagers an exhausting struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are in the red,” an employee wrote in the local health authority’s safety monitoring system, in an almost daily routine at the 12-bed facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On shift after shift between November and April, the regional rangatahi adolescent unit did not have enough experienced staff to properly care for the severely unwell teenagers admitted to the facility, according to safety logs obtained by the Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that six-months, employees recorded dozens of “safe staffing” incidents, which show how employees regularly worked overtime to cover roster gaps, rationed the care they provided, and worried about the safety of their colleagues and the highly vulnerable patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conditions at the unit — which provoked a confrontation late last year between staff, unions, and management — are a stark illustration of a workforce crisis gripping <b>mental health</b> services across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, a Herald investigation has detailed how a disjointed, underfunded public <b>mental health</b> system has been pushed to the brink without enough skilled staff to cope with rising distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the key points from our reporting:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staffing shortages are having a direct, significant impact on the availability and quality of care for people who desperately need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald’s investigation has documented numerous instances of frontline services being disrupted, restricted or withdrawn because of staffing issues. The rangatahi unit is one example. Another is the Central Region Eating Disorder Service, which provides intensive treatment to people with anorexia and bulimia in the lower North Island. It closed for 12 days in December because it didn’t have enough staff, according to a briefing by health officials to Health Minister Andrew Little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, <b>mental health</b> providers have raised thresholds for access to specialist treatment. People who are accepted into services face increasingly long waits for assessments and therapy; in too many cases the care provided is inadequate or inappropriate. Often those in crisis are directed to hospital emergency departments where they wait for hours in distress only to be sent home with little follow-up. It’s nearly impossible in some places to find vacant beds for patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many people with life-altering mental conditions are not getting timely and effective care, with potentially enormous consequences for their safety, wellbeing, careers, finances, schooling and relationships. Thousands of Kiwi families are enduring unnecessary anguish because they can’t get help for their loved ones. The <b>mental health</b> crisis is also putting huge strain on communities, charities, GPs, schools, police and other public services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff on the front lines are doing a heroic job, but they’re exhausted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caring for people with a serious <b>mental illness</b> requires a lot of skill, experience and tolerance. It’s not an easy job at the best of times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because services are so stretched, clinicians are often carrying much bigger case loads than recommended. They regularly work overtime and double shifts. They’re spending more time with patients in crisis, which is time-consuming, stressful and catastrophic if something goes wrong. In some places, inexperienced staff are being put into situations they’re not equipped for, without adequate supervision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many clinicians have opted to leave <b>mental health</b> services for high-paying, less stressful jobs in other public bodies or private practice. Some went to <b>Australia</b> instead. Those who remain feel increasingly “hopeless”, according to one clinical psychologist, because it seems increasingly harder to provide the treatment their patients need — and because they don’t feel the Government or their bosses in regional health authorities are truly listening to their concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There just doesn’t seem to be a way out of our current situation,” the psychologist says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This crisis has been brewing for years. <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> added to the strain, pushing more people into distress and compounding the workforce problems, but it didn’t cause this crisis. The alarms have been blinking red for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1990s, the landmark Mason inquiry identified workforce constraints as “probably the most significant concern in the <b>mental health</b> sector”, and called for an urgent national strategy to get sufficient numbers of psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists and other professionals into the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next few decades, however, successive governments failed to develop an adequate pipeline of homegrown talent, while also not doing nearly enough to reduce the demand on services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people seeking <b>mental health</b> treatment rose steadily but services remained fragmented, disconnected, inconsistent, under-funded and understaffed. District health boards relied on the goodwill of staff to do more with less and recruited heavily from overseas, but international recruitment became much harder after the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour gets it, to some degree, and has initiatives under way to expand the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Jacinda Ardern’s administration made <b>mental health</b> the top priority in its much-hyped 2019 “Wellbeing” budget and it has committed about $2 billion to <b>mental health</b>-related initiatives, including workforce development. On Friday, Little announced a new initiative that he promised will put more “boots on the ground”, a regulatory change that will allow counsellors to work in clinical roles in public services for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health officials say they’ve created around 990 frontline <b>mental health</b> jobs in primary care settings in the past few years, and added about 710 new graduate nurses to specialist services. In internal briefings obtained by the Herald, they told Little they’re working on a range of other “innovative” measures to expand the workforce that will relieve the pressure across the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Government needs to do a lot more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald interviewed dozens of clinicians, support workers, managers and others across the sector who welcomed the increased focus this government has brought to <b>mental health</b> but say its big ambitions haven’t yet improved conditions on the ground. On the contrary, they say, pressures at the hard end of the system have got worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour chose to prioritise setting up early intervention for people with milder conditions in primary settings, a gap that needed filling, but clinicians in specialist services say this came at the cost of improving other parts of the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While ministry officials work on out-of-the-box measures to bring new recruits into the sector, experienced staff are continuing to leave because they’re fed up. In the past two years, 1778 nurses left the sector, an “exit rate” of close to one in five, according to Nursing Council figures. The exodus drains from the system vital skills and expertise that can’t easily be replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re going as fast as we can,” Little told the Herald, but senior figures in the sector are running out of patience. They want urgent measures to stop existing staff leaving — including paying them better. More broadly, they want clear, ambitious plans to improve services, including an overhaul of the training regimes to develop a better pipeline of homegrown psychiatrists, psychologists and other specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a project that will take years, perhaps decades, and it will require sustained attention and investment from future governments beyond this one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week-long Stuff investigation has probed the state of our health system as it grapples with unprecedented patient demand and the largest structural upheaval in decades. Today Philip Matthews look at the health workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--------------------</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were more than 200 of them, sitting quietly, paying close attention. They sat in rows in a seminar room in Singapore, listening to a pitch from <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accent Health Recruitment general manager Prudence Thomson, who flew from Christchurch to run the seminar, estimates that about 80% of the 217 nurses in the room had already made up their minds to move to <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike some other nationalities, Singaporeans aren't notorious for being what Thomson calls "tyre kickers".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, she says, the nurses were not only from Singapore. There were some from the Philippines, who had been working in Singapore for years, and a cohort from Myanmar who should be able to get to <b>New Zealand</b> once they get their documents out of their home country, which is not proving easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Thomson's recruiters, Hannah Cotter, says the first two nurses from the Singapore recruiting trip should be here by October. The remainder will arrive over the following 24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was pleasantly overwhelming," Thomson says, back in her Christchurch home office. The last time she did one of these trips, before <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, there were 68 candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A registered nurse herself, Thomson has been in the health- recruiting business for about 25 years and the current shortages in the workforce are the worst she has seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her company is getting calls from "everywhere": residential care, private hospitals, GP practices and the new Te Whatu Ora-<span class="companylink">Health <b>NZ</b></span> structure that replaced district health boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<b>Covid</b> happened," she says. "<b>Covid</b> made for a sicker population. <b>Covid</b> has tired out the health workforce, plus we've had a retiring workforce. The last three years we've had people who perhaps have been a bit burnt out and want to retire earlier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political wrangles over the nurses' collective agreements have added to background angst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's multifactorial, but it's mainly <b>Covid</b>," Thomson says. "It's increased patient load. The last three years, if people had a lump or a bump or a hip they needed replaced or something that needed looking at, they probably didn't go to the doctor, so now people are sicker."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who work in the sector talk about insufficient long-term planning, the over-reliance on an imported workforce, and <b>Covid</b> and flu increasing patient numbers at the same time as health workers are themselves sick, all coinciding to create an unparalleled situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are various ways of measuring workforce shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A commonly quoted figure is that we are about 4000 nurses short, of which about 3000 are public health nurses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some cite bigger numbers. <span class="companylink">Association of Salaried Medical Specialists (ASMS) </span>executive director Sarah Dalton said in January that, to match Australian numbers per capita, <b>New Zealand</b> would need 1500 more hospital specialists, 1400 GPs and a staggering 12,000 nurses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalton quoted those figures long before <b>Covid</b> and flu hit the health system this winter. But emergency departments (EDs) were already over capacity and being "deliberately overstretched" was the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She warned that "for too long we've made a virtue of understaffing our hospitals and made a priority of balancing inadequate budgets". She was one of the first to call it a crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more recent survey by ASMS estimates an overall staff shortfall of 22%. The starkest example was seen this month in Wairarapa, where the emergency department was running at 50% of bare minimum and some nurses were working their 10th day in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aged Care Association (ACA) says it needs 1200 nurses, or about 25% of its normal workforce. Shortages in aged care are reflected in a dramatic increase in health and safety notices. There were 1875 notices in the first six months of 2022, compared with 851 in 2021 and 260 in 2020. About half of the 2022 notices concern nursing shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 800 health staff were sick or on leave in Canterbury alone in mid-July. But these problems are not limited to <b>New Zealand</b>. <span class="companylink">The Guardian</span> reported at the same time that more than 8500 Australian medical staff were in <b>isolation</b>, while nurses were doing double shifts and <b>mental health</b> patients were kept in the emergency department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if you subscribe to the view that this health crisis is largely beyond the Government's control, there are still things it could be doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomson thinks it is "insane" that nurses, midwives and physiotherapists were left off the immigration priority green list announced in May, while doctors and specialists were fast-tracked for residency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, registration bodies that cover nurses, midwives and physiotherapists have backlogs of people wanting to come to <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They need more manpower to process people, to get them here sooner," Thomson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Accredited Employment Work Visa (AEWV) also adds costs and processing time to smaller employers, such as general practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it remains a seller's market for those with experience and qualifications. Thomson has a Scottish midwife on her books who could choose from any of 20 locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some choices seem surprising. There are GPs from the Netherlands being interviewed for Ashburton and Marlborough. There was a GP who moved from Malta to Methven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Singapore, the nurses liked the promise of a <b>New Zealand</b> lifestyle and even cold weather, owning a car without paying Singapore's crippling car taxes and maybe getting more than one day off in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the recruiters' side, there is a degree of pastoral care involved. After Malta, Methven may be a culture shock. So the recruiters help them settle and they stay in touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, only a couple of days after getting back from Singapore, Thomson and Cotter are about to get on another plane, this time to Hamilton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are taking two GPs they recruited - one born in Hong Kong and trained in South Africa, the other born in Lithuania/London and trained in London - to dinner with a midwife, a couple of theatre nurses and a physiotherapist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these international health workers had existed only as faces on Zoom calls or names on emails before. All are working or about to work in Waikato.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Grave concerns'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly arrived doctors and nurses may come across Dr Rowan French, a surgeon at Waikato Hospital who is also president of the <b>New Zealand</b> Association of General Surgeons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early July, French wrote an open letter to Health Minister Andrew Little on behalf of his organisation. He CCed the interim chief executives of Te Whatu Ora and the new Te Aka Whai Ora- Maori Health Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a lucid expression of frustration. French wrote to "express our grave concerns for the future of our public health workforce". And while "the challenges facing public hospitals are foremost in our members' minds, we understand that primary care is also suffering a workforce crisis".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that "our members are very concerned that the current staffing shortfall is profoundly reducing their ability to deliver both elective (planned) and acute surgical care".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor was it just about <b>Covid</b> and winter flu hitting at the same time. There were deeper and longer- term concerns about permanent vacancies that were not filled, the increasing departure overseas of workers and a sense of disillusionment and undervaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French gave examples of public hospital operating theatres running below their usual capacity "due to dire shortages of nurses, anaesthetic technicians and medical radiation technologists".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems paradoxical, but workforce shortages and empty theatres meant surgeons were underemployed while surgical waiting lists grew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures released by National health spokesperson Shane Reti showed the number of people on the surgical waiting list doubled between July 2021 and this April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French agrees the public release of the letter was a bold move. "General surgeons are fairly reserved in terms of a group of specialists," he says. "I wouldn't say we're particularly vocal normally, with respect to advocacy. I've been on the executive for close to a decade and there have been examples in the history of the association of writing to the minister, but not in the last decade."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has colleagues who have been involved for 25 years and have seen nothing like this. Morale is so low that, when the switchover from the old DHBs to Te Whatu Ora happened this month, no-one felt like celebrating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while "cynicism doesn't help anyone", he was not encouraged by the thought of a new structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a lot of cases, we'll be dealing with the same people under a different email signature. Look, there are some very good people. But some of the people entering that structure are part of the reason why we've been in this situation in the first place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, nurses will always travel, he agrees. That is part of how they train. And lockdowns meant there was pent-up demand for travel. But French hears about nurses who are leaving for more than just an OE, who feel disillusioned with the system and know they will never buy a house here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So they're leaving for good," he says. "They're not leaving for experience. There's no doubt the <b>pandemic</b> had some impact in terms of affecting morale over a long period of time, and I think people were fine initially and it's just caught up with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But it's definitely a longer- term, structural issue that has just been brought into clear focus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if we lose nurses because we cannot compete with Australian offers, perhaps there are other incentives, French says. What about a fees-free model, or wiping student debt after a bonded period?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although I say we can't rely on overseas nurses, there's no doubt, particularly in the short term to medium term, it's going to have to be part of the answer. We can't just produce a whole lot of our own nurses immediately."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His letter did not just identify problems, it proposed solutions. One idea was a workforce summit, so that the Government, health bodies and education providers can all be synchronised. He gives an example of why this might be necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, universities have "decreed" a major change in how anaesthetic technicians train, taking them out of the apprenticeship model and into universities for three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So you've automatically lost, almost overnight, a large chunk of the anaesthetic tech workforce. If an anaesthetic tech isn't available, a whole theatre shuts down for the day. That's one or two surgeons, an anaesthetist, two or three nurses and a registrar who have to find something else to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association also hoped for an official acknowledgement of the crisis, rather than more palatable words like "challenge" and the claim that this is just a bad winter. When French and others hear that line from Little, there is "a massive collective eye roll".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another open letter attracted even greater attention a few days later. This one, from Women in Medicine, was written on behalf of more than 900 doctors from 30 sub- specialties. More than 93% of those who responded to the survey agreed there is a health workforce crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under cover of anonymity, they posted alarming and distressing comments about work in stressed and understaffed hospitals. They talked of leave cancelled, nurses off sick or burnt out and the pressure to take on more hours to help out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comment from a GP was typical: "Six months ago, a senior GP at my practice resigned with no job to go to . . . They were not able to be replaced. Three of the four nurses left for a variety of reasons. Another long-established senior GP just didn't come back to work one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The patient load fell on the staff remaining. My patients wait six weeks for a booked appointment at the moment. The practice manager has resigned now . . . A colleague recently came into my room distressed and requiring <b>Mental Health</b> Crisis team involvement. I wonder grimly who will resign next? I worry frequently about the patients caught in the middle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We have the capacity, the ability and the willingness'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When nursing shortages struck Dunedin Hospital this month, management arrived at an ingenious but controversial solution. They called on 21 nursing students and paid them with supermarket vouchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to recognise that desperate times call for desperate measures while also seeing a clear sign of a workforce in crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, the president of the <span class="companylink"><b>New Zealand</b> Nurses Organisation</span> (<span class="companylink">NZNO</span>), Anne Daniels, is a nurse in the same city. She believes the widely circulated figure of a need for 4000 nurses disguises an "astronomical" number and that, if a system called the Care Capacity Demand Management (CCDM) programme was fully implemented as it is supposed to be, we would have a better sense of the real crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know this because our members are telling us they go to work and, more often than not, they have less than half the staff who are supposed to be rostered on, according to rosters that may or may not involve CCDM," Daniels says. "Four thousand is a guesstimate, really."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is this simply a <b>Covid</b>-era issue, in her view. "The burnout and what we call moral injury has had a major toll over the last few years. That was happening pre- <b>Covid</b>. We have been saying to successive governments that staffing levels are unsafe since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have depended on nurses to not protest too much," she says. "We are a female- dominated profession, and women have been treated as second-class citizens, paid less and our conditions at work are less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You know we're going through an equity process at the moment, and our comparators were the police. We have agreed with the pay rates that are being negotiated but we're fighting for the back pay that was agreed on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But the police get 12-14% superannuation. We get 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's just one small item that shows how we have been absolutely done to for decades. We are now extremely angry. And we are not going to accept this any longer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relationship is fraught, to say the least. It didn't help that Little, himself a former union official, described the <span class="companylink">NZNO</span> as "speaking with a forked tongue" during a recent media interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many in the sector, Daniels was perplexed by the Government's decision to leave nurses off the immigration green list, but she is also mindful that making it easy for foreign nurses to work here is just part of the solution. She says we must train more of our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Council of Nurses</span> reports that <b>New Zealand</b> has the highest number of foreign- trained nurses in the <span class="companylink">OECD</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures from the Nursing Society show that 31% of our nurses are foreign-trained, but in 2020-21, 50% of nurses added to the register were foreign-trained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year before that, there were 2724 foreign nurses added, compared with the annual average of 1800 local graduates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council's report Sustain and Retain in 2022 and Beyond notes that English-speaking <span class="companylink">OECD</span> countries such as <b>New Zealand</b> take relatively more nurses from lower-middle-income countries than non-English-speaking <span class="companylink">OECD</span> countries such as Switzerland and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with nurses, the burden of workforce pressure has been falling on GPs. Bryan Betty, medical director of the College of GPs, warns there are too few GPs coming onstream to replace those leaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As there is an estimated shortage of 1500 GPs nationally, wouldn't it seem obvious to train more? That is not as easy as you might imagine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with nurses, our dependency on overseas-trained doctors, who make up about 40% of the workforce, makes us vulnerable, says Warwick Bagg, deputy dean in the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the <span class="companylink">University of Auckland</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that vulnerability, there is what he calls the morality question. "At the moment every country is trying to meet their workforce needs, but you have to think about whether we are being a good global citizen by importing other countries' doctors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bagg has direct experience of that predicament, as he moved to <b>New Zealand</b> from South Africa. "I'm happy to give my personal example," he says. "Where I was born definitely needs doctors, but I don't live or work there. That was my personal decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bagg has been outspoken about the need to train more doctors. Auckland's medical student numbers are set by the Tertiary Education Commission at 257 a year. The other medical school, at Otago University, is set at 282.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medical students are expensive to teach. They cost about $60,000 a year and the taxpayer covers $46,000 of the bill. The last major rise in their numbers followed the 2008 election after Labour and National got into a bidding war. Labour promised another 100, so National doubled the offer, and eventually funded 175.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In words that sound oddly familiar, National's then health spokesperson Tony Ryall said, "the health system is in crisis, with workforce shortages in many professional fields", and "we're among the world's biggest exporters and importers of doctors. This can't go on. We need to move towards self-sufficiency".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was 14 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National's plan was to boost the medical school intake to 565 by 2014. But it is stuck at 539.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent requests for an increase have been pushed back. A request for an additional 30 places in 2020 was formally declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">University of Auckland</span> has asked again, and the request is being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would argue that it is cost- effective," Bagg says. "We have the capacity, the ability and the willingness. And we can start that increase from next year's intake. We're built to take 300 students."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bagg says more students must be funnelled into general practice. Overseas doctors, particularly from the UK, who work in <b>New Zealand</b> for a couple of years and then return home create "enormous churn within the health system".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we undoubtedly benefit from the skills and experience of an imported workforce, "it would be much better if we had more of our graduates who are trained for Aotearoa's specific health needs, and who stayed in the country".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he doesn't think the current crisis might put potential doctors off a career in medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I haven't heard anything like that. Our own experience is that there's enormous demand for medical student places. We could take two or three times the current number if we had places for all of them, and make excellent doctors from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still considered a very desirable profession and it's hugely competitive to get into."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little has previously explained that one of the challenges to boosting medical student numbers is the lack of capacity in our hospitals to supervise and train student doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for nursing, <span class="companylink">University of Auckland</span> head of nursing Julia Slark mentions a national pipeline group chaired by Margaret Dotchin, chief nursing officer in what was formerly the <span class="companylink">Auckland DHB</span>, that is looking at ways to increase the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slark's message was brief as she happened to be off work with <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> when Stuff contacted her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do want to try and train more nurses, but the cost of paying for their education and trying to balance working and studying are key barriers for potential and current students."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Everyone's just shattered'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was the current crisis predictable? National's Shane Reti notes that a year ago, on July 28, 2021, then Hawke's Bay DHB chief executive Keriana Brooking wrote to Carolyn Tremain, chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment</span>, on behalf of all DHB heads, warning of the potential for "critical workforce issues".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Reti mentioned the letter in Parliament in June, Education Minister Chris Hipkins spoke for Little and said, "the Government has been aware for some time that our health system was likely to come under significant pressure this year as the borders reopened as a result of two things: <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> and what we fully expected and fully planned for - a more challenging flu season than we have seen, because, over the last two years, we've seen very low levels of influenza".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hipkins added that "the Government has been working alongside the health sector to plan for that. I would, however, note that there is a global shortage of trained healthcare workers, and that is something that <b>New Zealand</b> is experiencing - the same as many other countries are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Government has been working hard to recruit in order to fill vacancies, and of course to train more people. But you cannot train them overnight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But former ASMS director Ian Powell argues the Government largely ignored the workforce crisis it inherited and focused instead on restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little and others in the Government are hesitant to talk about a health crisis. In a radio interview this month, Little talked instead of "a chronic staffing shortage", and the terrible <b>Covid</b> and flu season that has put pressure on the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledged the "despairing comments" in the Women in Medicine survey but reminded listeners that the Government has added about 5500 doctors and nurses to the public system over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reti, himself a former GP and DHB member, has no such reluctance to use the C-word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a crisis," he says. "In fact, show me one part of the health system that's not in crisis, from community care to secondary care to aged residential care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've had GPs, you've had specialists, you've had midwives, you've had everyone pleading with the minister to at least acknowledge it's a crisis, a health workforce crisis primarily."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reti was in Northland during the parliamentary recess when Stuff contacted him. His view is that Little has done serious damage to important relationships with the sector. The nurses with their so-called forked tongues were just one example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also cited the case of Little telling GPs their models are outdated, and ED specialists being told their figures could not be trusted. "Wow! This is every part of the sector he's disparaged and demeaned and this is why they have no trust in him."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reti seems to have a knack with numbers and percentages. Here is one that intrigues him, concerning whether nursing is still an attractive career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we know is about 20-24% of nurses pull out in their first year," he says. "We need to understand that. It interests me as to whether we need to be doing more wraparound to make sure we retain people through the process. It's probably fine-tuning rather than big core stuff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the infamous green list problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No-one understands that. I don't understand that. Their argument, which they've started to realise is flawed, is that nurses coming here would then leave. That they are a flight risk. That is absolutely not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He [Little] knows it because of a ministerial answer he gave me which showed that in year one of our international medical graduate nurses, there's a 95% retention rate, and in year two, it's 90%. A very high retention rate. Trying to argue this is due to flight risk just defies their own data."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Little says: "A 10% loss of overseas qualified nurses after two years is a significant loss and more than for other overseas qualified professionals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Reti's view, only "entrenched ideological positions and stubbornness" have kept the Government from fixing the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He returns to Brooking's warning from July 2021. "She said in her final comments that if we don't get health workforce changes, and they had two recommendations, one of them was urgent changes to immigration, we will not avert a health crisis. Even the DHBs were using that terminology a year ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesperson for Little said he saw the letter only in May this year, but Reti thinks that is not credible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Reti acknowledges this problem long predates this Government, as Ryall's comments from 2008 indicate. "First of all, in our hands, we needed to build up the health workforce as well," Reti says. "I'm going way past my time in Parliament. I can't explain why we didn't turn our domestic tap on, for example. I don't understand that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone's exhausted," he concludes. "Everyone's just shattered. And here we are doing the biggest health reforms in 20 years in the middle of this environment. Those chickens are coming home to roost."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police confirm ‘violent trend’ but link higher numbers to better reporting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of retail crime — from shoplifting to vandalism and ram raids — have almost doubled in five years, with police and the sector confirming a “violent trend”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will come as no surprise to many shopowners dealing with a wave of youth-focused crime, which experts say bucks general trends down and is likely fuelled by <b>pandemic</b>-related angst and social media infamy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police say a lot of the increase is down to improved reporting processes, but the National Party lays blame on “soft on crime” policies under the Labour Government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a youth advocate has rubbished calls for more punitive actions, saying young people are being let down by inadequate resourcing for preventive measures and to address complex social issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly average of retail crime reported increased from just over 4000 in 2017 to just under 8000 in the first six months of this year, according to statistics provided to the National Party by police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police national retail investigation manager Matt Tierney said that in recent years police had worked much more closely with the retail sector to understand how much crime was occurring and where hotspots were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This included a 2019 Retail <b>NZ</b> survey that found as much as 70 per cent of retail crime was not being reported, Tierney said. “[The increase] is not actually a bad thing. If you understand the problem, the hotspots, then you can start to focus staff and preventative measures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotspots were urban areas, in particular city centres in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year in particular police made a “concerted effort” to engage the sector, urging that all crime be reported, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was “inconclusive” if there had been an actual rise in retail crime, Tierney said, but he accepted there was an increasing trend in violent crime and by younger people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is from straight intimidation to shoplifting and assaults — there is genuinely a heightened environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are many social reasons, from <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> and cost of living, but people are much quicker to anger these days.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police and the retail sector had been working on resourcing and de-escalation training, and the Government was addressing broader social issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All we can do is bring [young people] before relevant authorities and trust them to play their part. How they manage from there is up to them, but there are many factors at play.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail <b>NZ</b>’s Aimie Hines said she agreed the increase in statistics was largely due to better reporting, which was “crucial” to understanding the scale of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the greater co-operation with police had been a “success”, she said, with repeat offenders arrested and shopowners better equipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said it was clear <b>Covid</b> and the higher cost of living had added stress to people’s lives and there had not yet been a “national conversation around how to deal with that”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But from our perspective there is an action plan and that has been a success so far.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Party justice spokesman Paul Goldsmith said comments better reporting was behind the increase were “pure speculation”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is what everyone can see on the street, a general sense of disorder, that things are not under the control of law.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there had been “four years of a soft on crime mentality”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are seeing an increase in violent crime, and the justice system naturally needs to focus on that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for lower-level offending, a lack of action had fed through to a “sense of lawlessness”, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In Epsom, Newmarket, we used to have stores open on the street, now they only open internally into malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They are locking those streetside openings due to shoplifting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldsmith said there needed to be a broad look at the justice system from social issues including rising truancy rates in schools, but also “meaningful consequences”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lifewise youth housing team leader Aaron Hendry said contrary to recent reports, in the longer term there had been a decrease in youth crime and recidivism since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we also know is that a proactive community approach to addressing youth crime is what works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those offending often face extreme poverty, homeless or insecure housing, unsafe environments, disabilities, <b>mental illness</b> and addictions. They often lack support, hope and connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are complex challenges, and locking them up addresses none of them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hendry said it did not mean young people should not “understand consequences”. “We need more of a focus on restorative justice, helping them understand what they did and what impact it had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now they are dealing with trauma, they are hurt, and that is all they are thinking about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now we are failing them, we are not providing enough support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The focus is on police, the courts, corrections, and we are not giving significant resources to the communities to do this work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minister of Police Chris Hipkins said since launching a programme in May, police were working closely with vulnerable small businesses to “identify effective and practical solutions based on the particular features of each location”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least five stores in Auckland had preventive devices funded and over the next month 15 more shops there and in Waikato would be assessed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 500 retailers are expected to qualify for the fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A retail investigation unit set up last November had resulted in 31 offenders being charged with 203 theft and violent crime offences, including one offender who threatened to kill a retail worker with a firearm, before driving his vehicle at that person while fleeing the scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While police are successfully prosecuting, and the prevention activities are being rolled out, youth offending, including ram raids and other retail crime, is a complex long-term issue,” Hipkins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are stepping up our focus to steer our young off the road to crime through a range of programmes, including more support for at-risk youth, keeping them at school for longer and providing greater access to meaningful activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This will make a difference.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s been a milestone week in the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> with nods to the past and future, here and overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <b>New Zealand</b>, the face of public health during the crisis, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, stepped down from his role as director-general yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been an arduous position to hold over the past two and a half years, and Bloomfield leaves almost a year before his term was due to expire and after a quarter of a century working in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout, especially during the plunge into the unknown of the first <b>pandemic lockdown</b> in 2020, Bloomfield has been the epitome of unflappable reasonableness — delivering facts, advice and explanations at press conferences alongside the prime minister in a calm and calming manner. <b>New Zealand</b>’s own <b>pandemic</b> superhero spurned the cape to stay Clark Kent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a huge challenge and Bloomfield’s ability to be clear and make complex information about the evolving <b>coronavirus</b> crisis readily understandable has been an important part of how the country has handled the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the sad surge in <b>Covid</b>-linked deaths this year, potentially thousands of deaths were avoided in the first two years, and few comparable countries have done better overall. However, messaging on mask-wearing could certainly have been better early on, and Bloomfield bows out with the country still in a difficult position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although confirmed community case numbers have been dropping, they could once again remain plateaued as they have been for most of the past three months under the Government’s orange traffic light settings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And hospitalisations have been rising, with 827 on Thursday compared to 808 the day before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven-day average was 790 compared with 766 a week earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a markedly worse position than where the country was at on June 23 when 300 people were in hospital with <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">World Health Organisation</span> also notes <b>Covid</b> death rates have increased and several countries have reported rising hospitalisations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its <b>pandemic</b> response, <b>New Zealand</b>, as with other countries, has had to balance competing concerns, including health ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not just the <b>coronavirus</b>’ impacts but delays in dealing with other diseases, strains on medical workers, and people’s general wellbeing including <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globally there has been alarm at outbreaks of monkeypox, marburg virus and polio during the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report says that even long-time progress against Aids has been pushed “significantly off track” by <b>Covid</b>, according to Matthew Kavanagh, the deputy executive director of <span class="companylink">UNAids</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two new studies have suggested that the original theory about <b>Covid</b>’s escape — that it came from the wild via a Wuhan market — is still the most likely one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fear still lurks that history could repeat in a similar way at some stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, the White House held a summit this week on where the <b>pandemic</b> could be headed and what treatments need to be developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Joe Biden emerged from a bout of <b>Covid</b> telling Americans they can “live without fear” of the <b>pandemic</b> if they get booster shots and make use of treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US medical adviser, told the summit that despite the current vaccines the “job is not done”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: “Innovative approaches are clearly needed to induce broad and durable protection against coronaviruses known and unknown.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summit discussed the likelihood of a shot covering future <b>coronavirus</b> variants and vaccines in future being delivered by nasal spray — there are several in clinical trials — or skin patches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the US, developing the original <b>Covid</b> vaccines in record time with drug companies cost an estimated US$18 billion in federal investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a comparison, US military spending in 2021 was about US$800b.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developing new vaccines and approaches would also require significant resources for it to happen quickly and funding approval from Congress, so the summit was probably a plea to representatives and a message to the wider public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research efforts on new vaccines are fractured into various projects and are struggling without enough funding and other issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite weariness with the <b>coronavirus</b>, the world plainly needs to keep up research efforts to combat new threats, whether they be a variant or other viruses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research painting a grim picture of stagnating pay for Kiwi artists is unsurprising, says <span class="companylink">Creative <b>NZ</b></span> as it doubles down on work to address entrenched issues around pay and policy within arts organisations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artists who work for arts organisations were not expected to get pay increases this year but their managers and other organisational staff were, according to a <span class="companylink">Creative <b>NZ</b></span> report released earlier this month, which drew on data from 1566 individuals across 52 organisations. Despite the growth of arts organisations, artists had low or no pay increases for the year to November 2021, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, while salaries for management roles in arts organisations were expected to rise by 2%, and other arts organisation staff could expect a 1.7% increase, artists would likely see no increase at all, it found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research also found 65% of surveyed organisations paid interns, 59% had a named sexual harassment policy, 37% had a wellbeing policy, and 36% had an injury transition policy. Few collective employment agreements and unions existed for the surveyed organisations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arts Minister Carmel Sepuloni said the Government was aware of economic and career sustainability issues within the cultural sector, and it was a "priority" for it to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Creative <b>NZ</b></span> chief executive Stephen Wainwright said issues around pay in the arts were entrenched and change would take time. The agency worked with arts organisations to encourage good governance, financial management and policies. But more work was needed, Wainwright said. <span class="companylink">Creative <b>NZ</b></span> was considering initiatives it hoped would improve the issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would continue to measure the impacts of the arts on New Zealanders, and to explore the arts' potential in delivering government objectives across physical and <b>mental health</b>, education, justice, Corrections, tourism and international relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the agency released a pay policy for artists, arts organisations and those engaging with artists which outlined principles and practice guidelines on employment rights, contracts, fair pay and funding expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Government had given significant one-off batches of arts funding in recent years in response to <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, core funding levels remained "relatively static", Wainwright said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oranga Tamariki doesn't know how many children and young people in state care have attempted suicide in the past five years because it doesn't collate that data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the agency holds the information on individual files which one care-experienced rangatahi says isn't good enough and is demanding the Government collate the data, so the public know how big the problem really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry also doesn't know how many young people in state care have been diagnosed with a <b>mental illness</b> for the same reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that there is more work that we have to do around our data recording," Oranga Tamariki deputy chief executive of quality practice and experiences Nicolette Dickson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All of our case management recording is generally ... within our case management systems, and there's only certain structured data that we can produce on a whole of population level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, that did not mean Oranga Tamariki was flying blind, Dickson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people at risk of suicide were identified within their personal records and this would be monitored by the ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, she said the role of ministry staff was to screen for potential risk, rather than decide what behaviours amounted to suicide or self-harm. Ignored when asked for help</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ihorangi Reweti-Peters (Ngati Tuwharetoa, Ngati Kahungunu) says he has tried to take his own life several times, but each time it's been downplayed or ignored by Oranga Tamariki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He entered state care before the age of 1, moving in with his grandparents who he lived with until the age of 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that Reweti-Peters went to live with various caregivers, where at times, he says he suffered physical and psychological abuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He tried to take his own life on multiple occasions after the first <b>Covid</b><b>-19 lockdown</b> and spent time in a Christchurch <b>mental health</b> facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During that time, Oranga Tamariki were very dismissive. They didn't agree that I had any suicidal ideations or any problems with <b>mental health</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the beginning of 2021, Reweti- Peters says he spoke at the <span class="companylink">Child Poverty Action Group</span> post-budget breakfast where he called on the Government to make counselling and <b>mental health</b> support a statutory entitlement for every young person in care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes Oranga Tamariki should collate and publicly release data around <b>mental health</b>, suicide and suicide attempts in care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important in the public domain to see the extent of young people taking their own lives based on the trauma that they have experienced, either before entering into care, or while in the care of the state."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What data does Oranga Tamariki hold?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry does record the number of tamariki and rangatahi who have died from a suicide or suspected suicide - there have been five deaths since 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Oranga Tamariki doesn't record data on suicide attempts, it does know how many rangatahi are being monitored and supported because of their risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those figures are collected through the Towards Wellbeing Programme funded by Oranga Tamariki. It allows <b>mental health</b> clinicians to support social workers and assess suicide risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They provide us with statistics about the number of young people that they're working with currently," Oranga Tamariki general manager of specialist services Sharon Thom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a young person with a suicide risk was identified, Oranga Tamariki would place a suicide alert on the case management system, known as CYRAS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it came to recording or publishing data relating to suicide and suicide attempts, Thom felt it was important to consider the rangatahi behind the numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said young people in care were an extremely vulnerable population, usually coming from a background of abuse and trauma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're probably a group, at times, that are more predisposed to the risk of suicide and self- harming behaviour," Thom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people in care were also a group who sometimes faced stigma and marginalisation, she said. "I just think it's quite a tricky area, particularly for the young people that will be involved and being sensitive around their needs," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency support</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a young person was experiencing worrying thoughts, Dickson said the first thing a social worker would do is speak to them to gauge the level of risk. The next steps would depend on how serious the risk was, and could include referral to urgent <b>mental health</b> care or building a support plan around the young person.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moves include private workers in public sector clinical roles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health Minister Andrew Little will today announce a new initiative to “get more boots on the ground” in public <b>mental health</b> services struggling to cope with a rising tide of psychological distress, the Herald can reveal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of several “innovative” measures being pursued by the Government to alleviate a staffing crisis in the sector, hundreds of counsellors who provide talk therapies in settings such as schools, workplaces, helplines and private clinics will be able for the first time to work in clinical roles in public <b>mental health</b> services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to ministerial briefings obtained by the Herald, health officials have told Little the “right-touch” regulatory change could “open up a large workforce” that will ease strain on publicly funded <b>mental health</b> services that are facing critical shortages of psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and other skilled staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one briefing in March, officials told the minister “there is no silver bullet” to rectifying the workforce crisis – which has been years in the making and was amplified by <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> – and “ongoing and sustained effort and investment” will be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several “innovative solutions” including the counselling initiative are under consideration, the officials said, in what they hope will be a “demonstration case or early prototype” for workforce development in the new national health structure under Te Whatu Ora/Health <b>NZ</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even with these initiatives, it will be difficult to grow sufficient workforce, quickly enough, to fill the current gaps,” the briefing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little’s announcement comes amid growing dissatisfaction among the frontline clinicians who treat people with the most serious <b>mental health</b> conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, a Herald investigation has exposed how <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> magnified an already grave staffing situation, forcing DHBs to increase thresholds for admission and to ration the care they provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, people facing life-altering <b>mental health</b> conditions are facing long waits for treatment, getting substandard care, or missing out entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many staff are fatigued and demoralised and some have opted to leave for better-paid and less-stressful jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health authorities have struggled to replace those who have left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the Herald reported a call by the Royal Australian and <b>New Zealand</b> College of Psychiatrists for urgent investment to increase the number of frontline doctors to treat children and teenagers with serious mental illnesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a new development, it can also be revealed another branch of the <b>mental health</b> workforce — psychologists — are preparing for a showdown with the Government over concerns that their working conditions have “gone from bad to worse”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apex, the union that represents psychologists in the public sector, has written to its members recommending a new approach to negotiating with the Government after three years of strikes failed to address the shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apex told members it will push for a collective agreement governing psychologists across all public services to eliminate pay disparities and increase their collective bargaining leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would push up starting pay for psychologists in <b>mental health</b> services from $77,478 to $100,000, in line with their counterparts at Oranga Tamariki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The union also wants an overhaul of the training system to produce more homegrown recruits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health officials say they understand the strain on <b>mental health</b> services and are pursuing numerous options in the short- and long-term to expand the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments in the past few years have included the recruitment of about 990 <b>mental health</b>-related staff in primary care settings and the entry of about 240 newly trained nurses to specialist roles.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former coach Sir Steve Hansen says a split between <b>New Zealand</b> Rugby and top players has contributed to the All Blacks’ test struggles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen criticised <b>New Zealand</b> Rugby’s performance in an interview yesterday with Today FM’s Tova O’Brien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen believes Crusaders coach Scott Robertson is fully capable of stepping up to the All Blacks without gaining overseas experience first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All Black reject Robertson caused shockwaves in the game this week, saying he was ready to coach a rival test nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Razor is just positioning himself and good on him,” said Hansen, who began as a test coach by following Sir Graham Henry’s path to Wales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think Scott Robertson is a wonderful coach and his time will come. Then we’ll see if he’s ready or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The difference between Super Rugby and international rugby is massive. He has a great record and he can coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t think it matters [coaching overseas first] as long as you are flexible in your thinking and develop your rugby mind as you go. You can do it here in <b>New Zealand</b> or overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For me the route was overseas and it gave me the opportunity to go through adversity. I think all good coaches go through adversity at some point in their career, and we are seeing that with Ian Foster.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen said the under-fire Foster, his former assistant, was a “very good coach”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He won’t be happy with how things have gone of late but I don’t think the issue is just inside the team. There are bigger issues than that,” Hansen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wider issues included a decline in <b>New Zealand</b>’s standards at under-20 level and a rift between the administration and All Blacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The relationship between the board and the executive with the players at the moment is probably the worst it has ever been,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The way they handled the new [Silver Lake] money scheme ... [former chairman] Brent Impey came out and absolutely roasted the players, with no consultation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t think they [NZR] are doing their job right at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’ve got a group of great All Black captains coming out and forming a group which went and spoke to them ... Kirky [All Blacks great Ian Kirkpatrick] was in the paper saying they felt they weren’t listened to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Let’s start there, to get that right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look back to when we were really successful from about 2010 to 2019, which was our most successful era, the board and the executive at the rugby union were humming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was complete togetherness and connection with the actual All Black team.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said England and France had dominated recent under-20 World Cups, making it difficult to find the quality of players needed for the ABs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our high-performance department has to be squirming about our record at under-20 level,” he said. “Are we getting that side of our business right? I don’t think so.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The World Cup winner suggested reviews conducted by NZR had not sufficiently protected Foster and former Black Ferns coach Glenn Moore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sorts of actions would lead to a high turnover of staff, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There have been a lot of reviews recently — when did NZR do a self-review?” he asked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appeal for urgent action to fix <b>mental health</b> staffing crisis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children and teenagers could suffer life-long consequences because they’re not getting timely and effective <b>mental health</b> treatment from public services that are stretched to the limit, a group of leading psychiatrists has warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senior figures in the Royal Australian and <b>New Zealand</b> College of Psychiatrists are calling for urgent investments in the <b>mental health</b> workforce after a survey of frontline doctors revealed widespread concerns about the state of specialist <b>mental health</b> services run by the former district health boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ninety-seven per cent of child and adolescent psychiatrists surveyed by the college said the services that treat young people with the most serious conditions have experienced an increase in demand in the past two years, according to a write-up of the study published today in the Australasian Psychiatry journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-eight per cent of the psychiatrists say young people were often or very often unable to access adequate <b>mental health</b> treatment when they need it, according to the paper, which was obtained in advance by the Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large majority of the respondents said <b>mental health</b> services were not fit for purpose or heading in the right direction, despite commitments from the Government to improve them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANZCP surveyed 97 doctors, about 80 per cent of the child and adolescent psychiatrists practising in <b>New Zealand</b>. Most work in services run by the former DHBs, which are now part of the unified national health body, Te Whatu Ora/<span class="companylink">Health <b>New Zealand</b></span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have very complex young people with suicidal thoughts languishing on waiting-lists for treatment for seven months,” said one psychiatrist quoted in the article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another respondent said children’s services have been “utterly overwhelmed” by an unprecedented increase in referrals and the increased complexity and severity of the people they’re asked to treat. “Clinicians are burning out and families are on unacceptably long wait lists,” they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey echoes the findings of a major ongoing Herald investigation that has exposed how specialist services around the country are at crisis point after a surge in people seeking help for <b>mental health</b> problems collided with a workforce crisis years in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, a rising tide of mental distress has resulted in more young people experiencing problems such as depression, anxiety and self-harm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend was concerning before <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> but has been amplified by the <b>pandemic</b>, according to clinicians and health officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialist <b>mental health</b> services run by the former DHBs, which handle around 51,000 patients every year, are too underfunded and understaffed to keep up with the growing demand, according to a ministerial briefing obtained by the Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Child and adolescent services have long been under-resourced even compared to the rest of the <b>mental health</b> sector, receiving funding of $3600 per patient compared to $5800 per patient in adult services, according to Ministry of Health officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald’s investigation found the pressures on frontline services have become so great in the past year that many extremely unwell children and teenagers have been forced to endure long waits for treatment, received inadequate care, or missed out entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Frontline</span> staff are experiencing heavy caseloads, high stress, and low morale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have become so disillusioned and burnt out that they’ve left the public sector, and health authorities have struggled to replace them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> has one child psychiatrist for every 100,000 people, researchers say, about a quarter of the number recommended in the UK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, <b>New Zealand</b> has been heavily reliant on bringing in psychiatrists from other countries (about 60 per cent of the workforce were trained overseas) but international recruitment has become more challenging since <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of child psychiatrists trained domestically has not increased in recent years despite the rising demand, RANZCP said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They want more training places for skilled clinicians, better pay and conditions to retain staff who are already employed, and an overhaul of specialist services to make them more effective and efficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour made <b>mental health</b> one of its top policy priorities when it returned to power nearly five years ago and has committed around $2billion to <b>mental health</b>-related initiatives, including workforce development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Hiran Thabrew, a child psychiatrist and researcher at the <span class="companylink">University of Auckland</span>, one of the paper’s authors, says he has seen no sign of a central plan to expand the psychiatrist workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s not changed at all. In fact it’s been quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been almost like a relative neglect, because there’s been such a focus on primary care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Health Minister Andrew Little said: “This Government takes the <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing of New Zealanders seriously, including our youth, that’s why we are building a whole new <b>mental health</b> system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It important to acknowledge that while we have recruitment campaigns under way that include a focus on the <b>mental health</b> workforce, shortages in this area do predate the arrival of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> and to train for these roles at the specialist end can take seven to 10 years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest budget also included $18.7 million for specialist child and adolescent services, which officials say will allow them to see 1300 more people by 2025, Little added.</p>

</div><div class="author">Andy Loader </div><div>4087 words</div><div>27 July 2022</div><div>16:47</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>'s transformation from a country that was doing well by world standards, to a deeply divided society that is in decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were told back in 2017, by Jacinda Ardern, that her government is the most open and transparent government we have ever had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ardern in her first formal speech to Parliament pledged: "This government will foster a more open and democratic society. It will strengthen transparency around official information."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since her pledge to strengthen transparency and foster a more open and democratic society, her government has employed a large number of communications specialists and under their watch has maintained an iron grip on the control of information disseminated to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At every level, the Government manipulates the flow of information with press conferences and announcements, which are often meaningless or repetitive and prevent sustained or detailed questioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most open and transparent government that she promised appears to be pretty much non-existent in my opinion. This is partly because of the numbers of public relations staff that now seem to work to deflect and avoid, or answer questions from the electorate, in the most oblique manner possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most alarming trend is the almost complete refusal of government departments and agencies to allow the public to speak directly to staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole point of this communications strategy is to ensure that first and foremost, the government looks good and that the message is adequately controlled to make them look good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the job of the media to act as the public's watchdog and to ask the hard questions and hold the government to account on our behalf but that now seems to be a task that has been changed to one where the media has become another propaganda arm of the current government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the <b>Covid pandemic</b> the government decided to set up what they called the Public Interest Journalism Fund. It was set up on the basis that it would offer financial support to the media organisations to counter the effects of the <b>pandemic</b> and if that was all it was I would support the fund 100%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in actual fact with the requirements for the media to access the financial support relying on their promotion of the government's race based socialist agenda; I believe this fund is nothing more than the use of public funds to distribute government propaganda (or in other words corruption of the media) and as such I could never support it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unfortunately since Jacinda Ardern's pledge to strengthen transparency and foster a more open and democratic society, it has now become much harder than ever to get information from this government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since that pledge was made by Jacinda we have also gone down the track of implementing many of the recommendations from the He Puapua report which are totally undemocratic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact they are taking <b>New Zealand</b> down a path of race based co-governance by an unelected tribal elite on the basis of a "mythical partnership" requirement of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I say "mythical" deliberately because when you read the Treaty document there is no mention of partnership or anything that remotely resembles a partnership requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of their reliance on this mythical partnership requirement Jacinda' s government have made many changes to legislation and have proposed more, that have significantly altered the fundamental principles upon which our country has been governed and on our democratic rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent article, Muriel Newman from the <b>New Zealand</b> Centre for Political Research stated the following:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change represents a major threat to <b>New Zealand</b> - but not because of the emissions produced by cows and sheep or from driving cars to the shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest threat comes from the unhinged obsession of climate fanatics - including <b>New Zealand</b>'s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern - who are trying to force damaging policies onto the country that will have zero impact on the climate but will devastate the fundamentals of our economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, some background.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Monday, <span class="companylink">Statistics <b>New Zealand</b></span> revealed inflation had hit 7.3 percent - the highest level in 32 years. To deflect the negative publicity, the Finance Minister Grant Robertson called an unscheduled press conference the day before, to announce that the 25 cents a litre fuel tax exemption was being extended until January - to help ease the cost-of-living pressure on households: "We know that the rising price of fuel has a direct effect on inflation, and making these changes is a targeted approach to a root cause of the cost of living pressure being faced by Kiwi households."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Minister of Transport added: "Extending the reductions to fuel excise duty and road user charges will also help to reduce the fuel burden on the road transport sector, and in doing so keeping the cost of food and essential goods lower".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury was quoted, as estimating that lowering the price of fuel will reduce headline inflation by 0.5 percentage points in the June 2022 quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Minister's claim that the timing of his announcement, late on a Sunday afternoon, was not orchestrated defies belief. Clearly Labour went into damage control to try to defuse the negative media narrative. They also took the unusual step of emailing their supporters to reassure them that they were taking appropriate action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all of this highlights, is the staggering hypocrisy of the Ardern Government. On the one hand, they are reducing fuel taxes to minimise the inflationary impact of rising fuel prices - while on the other hand they are progressing radical zero carbon goals, which are designed to drive fuel prices and inflation even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With today's carbon price, established through the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), sitting at around $75 a tonne, the carbon tax on petrol is almost 17 cents a litre and over 19 cents for diesel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how high does the Prime Minister want it to go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Climate Commission, to get to Jacinda Ardern's "ambitious target of net-zero by 2050", the Emission Trading Scheme's carbon price would need to rise up to $250 a tonne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since every $20 increase in the per-tonne price of carbon results in the cost of petrol at the pump increasing by 5 cents, at $250 a tonne, the carbon tax on fuel would rise to over 60 cents a litre. On today's prices, fuel would be pushed towards $3.50 a litre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We now know only too well what the result of that will be - to use the Finance Minister's words, "the rising price of fuel has a direct effect on inflation" and is "a root cause of the cost-of-living pressure being faced by Kiwi households."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not just fuel prices that are being driven higher by the rising price of carbon - electricity prices are as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's NZCPR Guest Commentator is Bryan Leyland, a power systems engineer, who explains that if the government continues its pursuit of carbon zero, "escalating power prices and frequent shortages seem inevitable':</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, the carbon tax is about $75 per tonne of CO2 and the Climate Commission predicts that it could go as high as $250 a tonne. Every $50 increase in carbon tax increases the cost of generation at Huntly by at least 2.5¢ and 1.5¢ at a gas fired station. "Green' geothermal stations also pay carbon tax on the carbon dioxide they emit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Between 2004 and 2018 wholesale electricity market prices increased at a rate above inflation - from about 7¢ to about 10¢. In 2018 prices jumped to about 15¢ and have been relatively steady at more than 20¢ for the last two years. This doubling of the wholesale price is already showing up in commercial and industrial tariffs and retail tariffs must soon increase. The economic damage will be huge and the underprivileged will be even worse off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all of this means is that if Jacinda Ardern continues on with her "obsession' of wanting to be seen as a global climate change leader, our economy will be sacrificed through the harshest restrictions in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process is already underway, with climate objectives increasingly embedded throughout our whole regulatory and legislative framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last week the Climate Change Minister, Green Party co-leader James Shaw, signalled his intention to tighten up the ETS to force the country's big emitters to "make a larger contribution towards meeting our goal of building a net-zero future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To achieve this, he intends reducing the availability of the "industrial allocation" of free emissions units, that were introduced when the manufacturing sector was first included in the ETS - in order to protect emissions-intensive and trade-exposed businesses from unregulated foreign competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry for the Environment consulted on this proposal last year, and the feedback was alarming. The first cause of concern was that the number of proforma submissions from environmental activists clearly indicated that the ETS is seen as a political lever to close down industry in <b>New Zealand</b>. And the second, is how vulnerable our key industries are to ETS changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affected parties who manufacture critical products in <b>New Zealand</b>, such as cement and fertiliser, claim Minister Shaw's proposed changes may force them to close down - not only at a cost of hundreds of jobs, but also resulting in the importation of replacement products from overseas countries with no emissions controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>'s only cement works, Whangarei-based Golden Bay Cement, which employs around 550 staff, warned that changing the baseline and allocation settings, would increase production costs above the costs of imports, "which will shut down <b>New Zealand</b> operations in favour of imports - increasing global emissions as a result."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Winstone Pulp International</span>, which employs 281 staff at the Karioi Pulp Mill near Ohakune, says phasing out Industrial Allocations would erode their competitive situation internationally and result in processing capacity being transferred offshore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Taranaki based methanol producer <span class="companylink">Methanex</span>, which employs 240 staff locally and over 3,000 nationally, explained, "Our competition is global, with major methanol production occurring in China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, and Qatar. None of these countries applies a carbon cost to methanol production today; in fact, over 90% of methanol production globally does not attract an emissions cost, and therefore the Industrial Allocation is essential for <span class="companylink">Methanex</span> to continue operating in <b>New Zealand</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Methanex</span> also explained that while <b>New Zealand</b> methanol is produced from natural gas, over half of the global supply is produced from coal, with an emissions profile five times greater. They said that because of the Government's ban on new offshore permits, the lack of natural gas supply had forced them to shut down their Waitara Valley facility. As a result, China had increased its coal-based methanol production to fill the supply gap: "This shutdown therefore runs directly counter to <b>New Zealand</b>'s stated policy of reducing global emissions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's the problem Jacinda Ardern created for <b>New Zealand</b> in 2018 when, without any official advice - or even Cabinet approval - she made her Captain's Call to close down new offshore oil and gas exploration. In doing so, she turned her back on the decades-long strategy of successive governments for <b>New Zealand</b> to be as self-sufficient in energy needs as possible, and, as a result of her recklessness, Kiwis no longer have security of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality we face, is that under Labour and the Greens, anything is possible - regardless of how destructive it is to the economic well-being of local communities. Through the stranglehold of climate laws and regulations, at the stroke of a pen the radicals now have control of every industry in <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can any business make long-term investment decisions when they could be crippled by the madness coming out of the Beehive?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer is they can't. There can be no trust that the Ardern Government will act logically or sensibly - given they have failed to do so in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> increasingly stands alone, hobbled by punitive climate restrictions that have been justified on the basis that such controls are necessary to avoid constraints on trade - yet the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> trade deal exposed the fundamental fallacy of that rationale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that countries are increasingly backing away from the demands of green fanatics for their low carbon fantasy, instead prioritising economic stability and public wellbeing over <span class="companylink">UN</span> socialism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Jacinda Ardern come to her senses and abandon her dangerous commitment to net-zero before more damage is done to our fragile economy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's the fundamental problem. The climate crisis is a political crisis - not one rooted in the real world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has arisen because successive governments have adopted the radical socialist agenda of the United Nations to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide as a means of regulating their economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justified under the guise of saving the planet, carbon is, in effect, a proxy for State control of all economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Helen Clark's Labour Government that led <b>New Zealand</b> down this path back in 2002, when they ratified the <span class="companylink">UN</span>'s Kyoto Protocol and introduced an Emissions Trading Scheme - even though it had been designed for industrial nations, not rural economies where the main "emitters' are cows and sheep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruminants, of course, play a major part in a natural cycle that goes all the way back to the dinosaurs. Grass lands sequester carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and when eaten by ruminants, carbon is released as methane, which breaks down into the carbon dioxide and water the plants need to grow. It's a cycle of life, yet this is what misguided politicians like our Prime Minister are trying to demonise!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When National won office in 2008, instead of repealing Labour's socialist climate agenda, they doubled down by signing up to the <span class="companylink">UN</span>'s Paris Agreement to limit emissions, even as the world's major emitters were walking away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> partially delivered on the <span class="companylink">UN</span>'s Paris objectives, when world economies shut down in early 2020, leading to a massive decline in man-made global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, instead of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels falling - as the <span class="companylink">UN</span> had led us to believe they would - the US State Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found they had risen dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Washington Post</span> of June 4, 2020, carried the story: "Global emissions plunged an unprecedented 17 percent during the <b>coronavirus pandemic</b>… Carbon dioxide levels are the highest they've been in human history, and probably are the highest in 3 million years. The last time there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere, global average surface temperatures were significantly warmer than they are today, and sea levels were 50 to 80 feet higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These real-life findings counter the dreadful scaremongering surrounding this issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They not only show that human emissions are so insignificant that their impact on the climate is negligible, but they also remind us that the earth has been both hotter and colder than today, irrespective of carbon levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that carbon dioxide is a trace gas that is present in only minute concentrations in the atmosphere - making up around 0.04 percent. Almost all carbon dioxide - 97 percent - is produced through natural processes including being released from oceans, rocks, volcanoes, and, of course, during the respiration of all living things. Only 3 percent of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is generated by human activity and of that, <b>New Zealand</b>'s contribution is an infinitesimal 0.17 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All around the world, governments are turning their backs on radical climate policies that will undermine energy security and economic independence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't it time <b>New Zealand</b> did the same?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Monday, <span class="companylink">Statistics <b>New Zealand</b></span> revealed inflation had hit 7.3 percent - the highest level in 32 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of government policies and the <b>Covid pandemic New Zealand</b>'s indebtedness has risen over the last couple of years, from 17% of GDP to approximately 58% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last thing that we can afford now under this debt load is to see our export income significantly reduced which is what will happen as a result of this government's fixation on agriculture being used to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Accord agreements. Even though article 2b of that Accord stipulates that it should be implemented in a manner that does not threaten food production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fundamental problem is that the climate crisis is a political crisis - not one rooted in the real world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that carbon dioxide is a trace gas that is present in only minute concentrations in the atmosphere - making up around 0.04 percent. Almost all carbon dioxide - 97 percent - is produced through natural processes including being released from oceans, rocks, volcanoes, and, of course, during the respiration of all living things. Only 3 percent of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is generated by human activity and of that, <b>New Zealand</b>'s contribution is an infinitesimal 0.17 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>'s total GHG emissions amount to 0.17% of the Global Total and the agricultural sector produces 48% of that total. That amounts to 0.082% of the global total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is stating that agriculture needs to reduce their emissions by 30% so in effect we are going to cripple our country's economy to save just 0.024% of the world's total emissions of Greenhouse gases a figure that is less than the amount of gases produced by volcanos (approximately 1%of the global total) around the world every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What this government is not telling its supporters is that they are most likely to be the ones that will have to carry the majority of the burden from these policies with the rampant rise in the rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labour government has traditionally been the party of choice for the lower socio-economic strata of society and as such any rise in inflation will hit them much harder than the more well off members of society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of food, rent, interest rates etc. are all severely affected by inflation yet incomes are not rising anywhere as fast which means that those at the bottom of the pile are carrying a far greater share of the burden as a percentage of their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those on or above the median income levels will maybe feel some effects but they will in the most part be able to afford to buy groceries and pay their mortgage or rent even if it hurts. But the Labour supporters at the bottom of the scale are the ones that will start to find that they can't even afford to buy sufficient food to feed their families let alone pay the exorbitant rents that this government's policies have caused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Jacinda Ardern's pledged to strengthen transparency and foster a more open and democratic society, they have made many changes which have significantly altered the fundamental democratic rights and principles upon which our country has been governed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those decisions have come with great costs for implementation and all of those costs have to be paid for by the taxpayer which in effect also creates an upward effect on inflation making the situation worse for those at the bottom of the scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is plainly obvious from recent poll results that Jacinda Ardern has suffered a loss of public trust and confidence in her leadership. For our ideologically-driven Prime Minister government incompetence is largely to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who could possibly have imagined when Prime Minister Ardern announced at a <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span> meeting in Switzerland that <b>New Zealand</b> was leading the world in the use of "wellbeing" as a measure of government success that under her watch public services would fail so badly?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has authorised a $500 million overhaul of the entire health system in the middle of a <b>pandemic</b> - just to satisfy the ideological demands of her Maori Caucus for co-governance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By disestablishing community health boards and sacking health leaders, our Prime Minister has left the health system rudderless and in meltdown and meanwhile, the new power-hungry <span class="companylink">Maori Health Authority</span>, which intends prioritising health care in <b>New Zealand</b> on the basis of race rather than clinical need, is swamping health staff with bureaucratic demands, instead of allowing them to focus on managing the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incompetence of the Ardern government is not just related to the health sector. They also promised to build 100,000 affordable homes over 10 years, to enable first-home buyers to enter the housing market and after four years, only 1,366 homes have been built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, over $1 billion has been spent on emergency housing, and the waiting list for a State house has escalated from 5,000 in 2017 to over 27,000 today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's Labour's wasteful spending - including $53 million on planning, announcing, and then cancelling the "Skypath" cycle bridge across Auckland Harbour. Or, the massive $1.9 billion that was announced with great fanfare to address problems with <b>mental health</b>, that seems to have disappeared almost without trace, even as demand for assistance skyrockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And how about the Ministry of Transport's plan to spend $197 million by 2024 on road safety and education campaigns to support their "Road to Zero' strategy - instead of spending the money on fixing roads!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than removing the red tape and bureaucracy that's holding the country back, Labour is busy creating more, with an example being their carbon tax which is now fuelling inflation across the whole economy and putting huge pressure on household budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since being first elected, Jacinda Ardern has been big on promises and expensive public relations campaigns, while often failing to deliver results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour has put in place funding for the mainstream media through their $55 million Public Interest Journalism Fund and part of the criteria for this funding is to support the government's propaganda. They are also planning to spend over $370 million merging Radio <b>NZ</b> and TVNZ into one "captured' State-run organisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that the Ardern Government needs to have a friendly media that turns a blind eye to their many of failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, it's not just the lies and broken promises that are causing a loss of trust in Jacinda Ardern's Government - nor the wasteful spending, the cost-of-living crisis, the housing crisis, the health crisis, the crime crisis, or even the education crisis. These are damaging and justification enough for the government to be defeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In education school truancy is at record levels and <b>New Zealand</b> is leading the world in declining standards with more than 40 percent of school leavers now unable to read and write properly. Yet it is a priority for this government to produce a sanitised view of <b>New Zealand</b> history that is acceptable to Maori.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even graduating students at our tertiary institutions are forced to submit to compulsory Maori cultural propaganda in order to receive their qualifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greatest act of shame that this Labour Government must be held accountable for is the way in which they have divided our nation by race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Jacinda Ardern prior to the 2020 election deliberately failed to inform the public that if elected, she would be prioritising co-governance and tribal rule as recommended in the He Pua Pua report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the total election majority giving Labour the power to govern alone, Jacinda Ardern's government has been making radical changes that have undermined our economy and attacked our democracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly what matters to Prime Minister Ardern is not defending our democracy and standing up for the Rule of Law, it's cosying up to the iwi elite, introducing tribal rule through co-governance, and rebranding all of our government departments with unpronounceable names "gifted" by Maori.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the failure of the fourth estate to question government decisions the essential character of <b>New Zealand</b> is being transformed from a country that was doing well by world standards, to a deeply divided society that is in decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the sake of <b>New Zealand</b>'s future Jacinda Ardern and her government need to go.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> is no longer the main concern for Kiwi business, falling to bottom of the list of issues keeping them up at night, a report shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small and medium-sized business are feeling the pinch of a tight labour market and immigration policy, with getting adequate staffing the biggest issue they face now, according to business consultancy firm Business Changing’s State of the Nation survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey of 200 business owners conducted in the first half of July found that for every 12 employees they had, they had one job vacancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 70 per cent of business owners surveyed said they had no confidence in the Government and its ability to steer the country through the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty nine per cent of businesses said that they were “somewhat worried” about their own personal wellbeing and <b>mental health</b> and 49 per cent said they were worried about the wellbeing of their team members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps surprisingly, despite the potential for disruption and staff sickness, <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> was found to be the least of business owners’ worries — with 70 per cent stating that they were not concerned about the ongoing impact of <b>Covid</b> on their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An expected pullback in consumer spending as shoppers moved to be more cautious around spending was the biggest issue business owners expected to face in the next 12 months, followed by rising costs driven by staff and suppliers, Government decisions and policies, alongside recruiting and retaining staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other findings show that service-based companies are performing better than product companies, compared to a year ago, and that product-based businesses had needed to borrow more money to survive the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty five per cent of product businesses said they felt their culture was now better than before <b>Covid</b>, compared to only 38 per cent of service businesses. Overall, 57 per cent of business owners said they had become a better leader and manager as a result of <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two thirds of businesses surveyed said they were nervous for the <b>New Zealand</b> economy over the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business Changing chief executive Zac de Silva says despite the economy facing challenges times and the outlook for the next wee while looking bleak, businesses should look at their business and practical ways they could improve their operations and workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Imagine you are 18 months in the future and your business is in some hard times. With hindsight, what would you regret not having done over the ‘past 18 months’ that would have had your business performing better in the future? This is one of the most important questions you can ask yourself today; and keep asking it regularly,” says de Silva.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chamber work at an end but not that of championing SMEs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m writing this in my office, perched on the top floor of the Auckland Business Chamber building in Symonds St, looking out on a magnificent island-dotted harbour and an endless horizon of opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have packed up my desk, tucked away the cuddly toys given to me to ease the pain of my cancer battle and am steadying myself for a round of farewells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I won’t be in this office after July 31, but I will be about and pursuing a busy work schedule, because even as I stand down as chief executive after 31 years of championing the best interests of Auckland’s tens of thousands of small and medium enterprises, the job is not done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will continue to be relentless, focused, and zealous to use the experiences, learnings and wide network of relationships I have gained in this influential role to change the things I can to better the health, wealth and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My ethos has been shaped, and I hope refined, by grasping hold of that simple tenet given to me by rugby legend, mentor and fellow cancer patient, Jock Hobbs to change the things you can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I took over as CEO in 1991, having worked as its international trade manager for eight years, I was determined to reframe and reimagine the role of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, as it was then, so it became more relevant to strike out on a new path into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I saw opportunity to move this fine institution beyond stuffy boardrooms and into the marketplace with a voice that could lobby and commentate on any range of issues from labour laws to port inefficiencies to slow and convoluted consenting. Its purpose was focused as an advocate for better, fairer, and more equitable outcomes for business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also put the chamber on a commercial footing so it no longer relied on membership fees but could pay its way successfully through a vibrant and energetic events programme, conference leadership, sponsorships and delivering important contracts to promote employment, skills, investment and business achievements for the good of a much wider community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am proud of a special partnership with the Ministry of Social Development we created to support Maori, Pacific and new migrants into work and becoming the leading agency helping young people get licences so they could be employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have also made the Chamber Business Awards a huge annual event to celebrate innovation and imagination as enterprises come together from across the Auckland region, and are supporters of Young Enterprise Awards and the Business Hall of Fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the chamber extended deeper into the community, taking up a social remit too and espousing the need for integrity, ethics and transparency in all business activities, we have continually improved the range of tools and expert mentorship we offer to support business to do better in good and tough times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocacy has always been a key role, not just for Auckland businesses but as a member of the chamber network across <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have earned our place as a trusted, credible and influential lobbyist, the voice of SMEs to policy and decisionmakers in local and central government with views that are worth listening to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have been vocal on major issues including diversity, immigration, roading, ports, infrastructure, economic development, fair pay, climate change and the need for <b>NZ</b> Inc. to lift the game to look outwards and compete internationally as a productive, competitive, skilled nation that is ready for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Covid</b> was a relentless battle, and we were indefatigable in our efforts to not only work with government to get relief financially to save jobs — and enterprises — but also to destigmatise and take care of business owners’ <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We got 60,000 signatures to a petition within 48 hours to show government that this was more than a health emergency as business sank under the weight of lockdowns and lockouts. Help was needed. They responded and the dialogue has not ceased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it went much further. My mailbox filled with heart-torn messages from despairing business owners and managers trying to navigate terrifying and unknown waters, faced with saving their enterprise from closure, retain staff, pay bills, put food on the table and see their home at risk of being taken by the bank as the tsunami of debt and no revenue mounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recognised those warning signs, and rather than simply sympathise we changed the game and so First Steps, a self-managed, self-help online portal was launched with the EMA and government as partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 70,000 business leaders have used this service and the hope is, with continued funding, that it will expand nationwide as the need has not waned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have worked with <b>New Zealand</b> prime ministers, ministers and officials without fear or favour, building the chamber into a recognised and respected brand that promotes the best interests of business, the SME sector the Auckland community and the power of positivity to recover and rebuild to be better than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So thank you Auckland for supporting me, the chamber and having confidence in the future of this great region.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daughter of bashed Chinese shopper says ethnic bullying on rise at school too</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avicious, racially motivated attack on a father of Chinese descent outside an Auckland supermarket has sparked a renewed call for stronger hate crime laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police are still hunting for the assailant following the attack on the software specialist and family man outside Pak’nSave Albany yesterday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A supermarket duty manager bravely stepped in to prevent any further escalation in violence, the Herald can reveal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one of two attacks on shoppers in Auckland this weekend, coming the day after an older man was left bleeding on the ground and seriously injured after being caught up in a brawl at Sylvia Park mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Albany victim’s daughter, a North Shore high school pupil who asked to remain anonymous, has spoken out about the harrowing unprovoked assault to raise awareness of what she says is a rising level of prejudice in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said there is an “awful” increase in the willingness of people at her school to bully others because of their culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father went to the supermarket about 8.30am, on the last day of the school holidays, to get food for her and her brother for school lunches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he approached the supermarket entrance he noticed a tall, well-built white man staring at him, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father thought he may have bumped the man as he walked past so turned around to say sorry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And then the other man just started swearing at my dad and saying ... really harmful language to him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments included “go back to where you’re from” and other racially charged remarks against the man, a first-generation immigrant who was born in China but came to <b>New Zealand</b> about two decades ago. “My dad was really confused about what he did to this man,” she said. Her father asked the assailant what he had done, at which point the attack turned physical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was kicked in the head and punched in the face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was trying to shield himself and ended up on the floor. The other man kept on kicking him and hitting him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father tried to hide behind a shopping trolley but the man continued his attack and at one point threw eggs he had purchased at him, the daughter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One witness, also a Chinese man, called the police and stayed with her father until they arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time officers arrived the attacker had fled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father had by this point been kicked or punched in his lower back, chest, stomach and head, and was covered in egg residue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was taken to a nearby White Cross clinic for assessment, having suffered multiple bruises to his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The girl said her father had never endured anything like the attack before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was really scary. Because this morning I was about to go with him. He was telling the police he’s really lucky he didn’t bring me along.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father said the man did not appear to have <b>mental health</b> issues or be on drugs and resembled “just a normal guy”. She said she believed there was a rise in racism on the North Shore in recent times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At school as well, people are not afraid now to bully people that are from different cultures,” she claimed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And they think it’s normal, because everyone around is also doing the same thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Foodstuffs <b>NZ</b></span> public relations head Emma Wooster confirmed the team at Pak’nSave Albany became aware of the violent incident while it was unfolding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A customer who was on the spot had already called police, and on arrival the store duty manager stepped in, helping to safely prevent any further violence,” Wooster said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One of the parties left the premises, the other was supported by the store team until police arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a shocking incident and a reminder that abuse or violence of any kind is not acceptable and will absolutely not be tolerated on our premises.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wooster said Foodstuffs wanted to thank staff at the Pak’nSave and the customer who called the police for their “swift and effective action”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police confirmed they received a report of an assault at the Don McKinnon Drive supermarket yesterday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A man was reported to have been verbally abusive towards two people and one of them was assaulted,” a spokeswoman said. “Thankfully the victim was not seriously injured ... by this assault but was understandably shaken by this incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we are in the very early stages of our inquiries, we are keeping an open mind into the motivation of this assault, including if it was racially motivated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police asked anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them on 105.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon said during the earlier years of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> there was a spike in racism against Asian people. “That has quietened down, but it’s always been there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And that is one of the primary reasons we really encourage the Government to [move] on the strengthening of the legislation on hate crime.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Royal Commission into the Christchurch mosque attacks found <b>New Zealand</b>’s legal system did not adequately deal with hate crime and hate speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the Government unveiled proposals, including a new criminal offence with harsher penalties and protections for more minority groups, and invited public feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This type of attack is not new to Chinese people,” Foon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Racism actually kills, and that’s why it’s very important that the Government gives law enforcement and the courts all the tools it can to actually stamp out racism.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those caught may have had their <b>mental health</b> affected during <b>pandemic</b> events</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was late one night in August 2018 that bar manager Gurmail Singh’s driving was a clue that not all was well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was seen driving up and over a kerb and then running over a small tree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over a year later he was sentenced in the Manukau District Court for driving while drunk. He was almost four times the legal breath alcohol level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2020 his bar manager’s certificate was suspended — again. The first time was in 2011, also after he was caught drink-driving, but this time the suspension lasted 56 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh is just one of 202 bar managers to have had their certificate suspended for drink-driving since January 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the numbers are relatively low given there are currently 36,000 certified managers, the percentage being caught is increasing and police say some of the readings coming back are extremely high — in some cases more than five times the legal limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decisions released by the Alcohol Regulatory and Licensing Authority showed that one-third of all suspensions since 2019 were for drink-drive offences. Most were for selling alcohol on premises to underage drinkers, plus a smaller number for violence and dishonesty offences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of 2019, 18.5 per cent of all bar managers suspended had been caught drink-driving. For the first six months of this year, that had jumped to 34 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for the increase aren’t clear, but one restaurant and bar owner said the <b>mental health</b> of staff and managers in the sector have been severely tested in recent times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Widley, who owned and operated a cocktail and whisky bar and a restaurant and bar in central Nelson said alcohol was sometimes used to self-soothe, and maybe the increase in drink-driving was linked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are many different types of <b>mental health</b> challenges faced by those working in the hospitality industry, and alcohol is an easy, accessible ... pacifier I suppose.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it was true that staff shortages afflicting the sector had generated major challenges, Widley did not think it had linked to alcohol harm and the drink-drive trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes, it’s got to the point we are training up anyone in the business as a duty manager if we feel they can do it. We can no longer pick or choose the cream of the crop when our borders were open, and we had internationally experienced Michelin-trained staff here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t see how staff shortages can lead to alcohol harm though. Upskilling our staff goes a long way to us preventing incidents.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widley said it wasn’t clear from the data if bar managers had been drinking while off work, or whether they’d stayed on to enjoy a drink in the bar before heading home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were a lot of people in hospitality over this time who spent a lot of time not working. Maybe these incidents happened when they were bored and had nothing to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of the union representing hospitality workers said it wasn’t something that had yet reached their radar, but the huge cultural shift within the sector led by mass redundancies and now staff shortages could be a factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Unite Union</span> national secretary John Cocker said <span class="companylink">Unite</span> tended to deal with the larger employers such as hotels, casinos and cinemas, which seemed to take alcohol harm reasonably seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Major employers did not allow ‘staffies’ or drinking on shift,” Cocker said. But speaking to a member from outside the major employers, he said some smaller employers were “looser” with alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There has also been a cultural shift in hospitality recently. Many people have left the sector, including through large-scale redundancies in 2020, and while employers are struggling to find staff, there may have been a drop in the quality of applicants for bar managers certificates.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A police spokesperson said some of the recent cases up seen managers who are more than five times the legal limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March this year Gisborne bar manager Franscine Simpson was stopped by police while driving and blew a reading of 1204 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath. The legal limit for a person over 20 years is 250 mcg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was convicted the following month and her manager’s certificate was suspended for 28 days, until July 24 this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2020 Chhring Puti Sherpa was caught driving with 165mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood — the legal blood/alcohol limit is 50mg. She was convicted, fined and disqualified from driving for seven months in April 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn’t until May this year her manager’s certificate was suspended, upon application by the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said that any duty manager convicted on a drink-drive charge was referred to the Alcohol Regulatory Licensing Authority for consideration of suspension or cancellation of their manager’s certificate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Duty managers are critical for ensuring the safe and responsible consumption of alcohol, and for ensuring licensed premises operate in accordance with the act and the premises licence conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As such, duty managers are held to a high standard of behaviour, both on and off duty,” a police spokesperson told Open Justice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The licensing authority said in one of its hundreds of decisions that managers who broke the law on drinking and driving, must expect their certificates to be suspended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Restaurant <b>NZ</b> Bar Managers Guide showed there were hefty rules around the operation of licensed premises, including that they must provide good information about transport options for customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was little literature anywhere on the consequences for bar managers who drink and drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Hospitality <b>New Zealand</b></span> advocated for its members on a list of policy matters. Apart from things like immigration, wages and workplace matters, there was a focus on harm minimisation in the gambling space, with the potential for government funding for more industry training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was little reference to alcohol, other than the organisation’s aim to address matters within Local Alcohol Policies (drafted by councils, which were among a list of authorities with oversight of licensed premises).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Hospitality <b>NZ</b></span> spokesperson said it would be announcing a Responsible Service of Alcohol Standards training programme for members at an upcoming conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widley was aware that the training programme had been in the pipeline for a very long time. He said it was developed to also recognise and support <b>mental health</b> challenges in the sector, but at the end of the day, it was also up to staff to front up to these challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can only lead a horse to water ... We are putting on seminars and events for people in the sector, but they need to come and yes, employers need to encourage staff to take part.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Road users riled by delays branded as selfish and arrogant</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki has hit back at critics of an anti-Government protest on Saturday, calling complainers “angry, self-entitled d********”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of people gathered at the Auckland Domain for the protest, organised by Tamaki and the Freedom and Rights Coalitions, before walking out onto the southern motorway about 11.30am, as police blocked off all traffic heading south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All southbound lanes on the motorway were closed as the protesters made their way from the Khyber Pass on-ramp to Market Rd, causing major traffic disruptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasons for the protest cited in a press release from the group included but were not limited to; the cost of living, hospital understaffing, overworked GPs, education problems, three-waters legislation, a <b>mental health</b> crisis and under-resourced first responders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many motorists were frustrated with the disruption to their weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamaki has hit back at critics, however, calling naysayers “angry, self-entitled d********”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A one-hour delay and interruption in their lives turns them into angry, self-entitled d********. A protest is meant to be disruptive, visible and has a right to happen. The last 2yrs of misery and chaos this Government has put us through is nothing compared to the 2hr inconvenience to traffic!” Tamaki said in a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintained “New Zealanders have lived so long in privilege and comfort” and that the people against him were arrogant and selfish, with no care for anything but “their money, pleasures and narcissist uninterrupted small lives”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> rant, Tamaki said “the nasty vile, negative and personal slandering that lies in the underbelly of this nation has made us the 2nd Worst Place to live in, out of 50 other countries that were canvassed in a recent poll”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remark was seemingly a reference to a survey of immigrants who considered <b>New Zealand</b> the second-worst country to move to out of 52 of the world’s nearly 200 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey was conducted by the expatriate networking organisation InterNations and was informed by responses from nearly 12,000 people of 177 different nationalities, living in 181 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auckland Central Area Commander Inspector Graeme Anderson said police had begun the process of prosecuting those involved in the protest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This will involve reviewing information and evidence to identify those involved in offending, including entering the motorway system on foot and other alleged driving-related offences,” Anderson said. “At this time we have not arrested and charged or summoned anyone in relation to yesterday’s protest activity. “</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Tamaki was arrested for breaching bail conditions and spent nine days in Auckland’s Mt Eden Corrections Facility. Before that, he was charged three times over attending Auckland Domain <b>lockdown</b> protests.</p>

</div><div class="author">Chris Keall </div><div>1705 words</div><div>25 July 2022</div><div>The New Zealand Herald</div><div>NZHLD</div><div>A030</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022 NZME Publishing Ltd. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Netsafe chief executive Brent Carey sat down to talk to the Herald about NetSafety Week 2022 — and recent issues with his own organisation, while retired judge David Harvey, an ICT specialist involved with the creation of the Harmful Digital Communications Act, discussed what went wrong with a recent Netsafe privacy blunder that resulted in a $100,000 payout, and a key mistake made by the Government when the legislation was first passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Carey has taken the reins of Netsafe after a dark time for the organisation — which serves as the lead agency for the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netsafe has been ordered to pay $100,000 in damages after a ruling that it infringed the rights of three women in a case involving an alleged stalker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The damages decision, released on March 22, came after long-time CEO Martin Cocker left the internet safety agency in December — mid-way through an investigation into alleged workplace bullying. He was not the subject of the allegations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An employment court hearing scheduled for June, involving alleged bullying, was headed off by a confidential settlement. The staff member concerned told the Herald they were not able to comment, due to the terms of the settlement. Carey would only say that Netsafe now has no employment cases outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the announcement of Cocker’s departure came on the same day Netsafe released the draft of its new Code of Practice for Online Safety and Harms — a document that saw advocacy groups raise concerns about its formulation and funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mandy Henk, chief executive of anti-hate speech and misinformation group Tohatoha, saw conflict-of-interest issues, while InternetNZ’s Andrew Cushen said the communities affected by the code should have been part of the initial drafting process (the final version of the code will be released later today as Net Safety Week kicks off).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 10 of the agency’s 25 staff have left since 2020 amid a stream of leaks about workplace bullying investigations. One ex-staffer told the Herald that in many cases, their <b>mental health</b> was shot by the time they departed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a new chairman (<span class="companylink">Fletcher Building</span>’s Colin James) in place since the New Year, and now a CEO since May, will there be a change in Netsafe’s workplace culture?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A new person obviously brings different ideas and so with that will come culture change,” Carey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly how? The new CEO says it’s still taking shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m out gathering information. ‘I’ve had a ‘staying’ interview with everyone that has stayed at Netsafe,” Carey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds, “I’m also putting my structure in place. We’ve got a new chief customer officer arriving, and a new chief legal adviser. And so then it’ll be clear when those roles are filled around what that work programme will look like.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief customer officer is a newly-created role, while chief legal adviser has been upgraded to a full-time, in-house position, replacing an eight-hour, outsourced role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, we’ve seen a shift in tone, at least, with Carey penning a personal letter of apology to the three women involved in the privacy breach case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funding boost requiredCarey says reports of cyberbullying to his agency have increased by 25 per cent each year since 2020. Over the same period, Netsafe’s budget ($3.94m in 2020, $4.06m in 2022 — with 95 per cent of its funding coming from the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice, and the balance from private sources) has been static.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does Netsafe need 25 per cent more money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The volume is not going away. When you’re running <b>New Zealand</b>’s hate hotline seven days a week, you’re going to get all sorts of incidents reported to you. And we are tagging those and making referrals. So certainly, I think there’s more funding that could be given to agencies,” Carey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If the work increases, then the funding has got to increase as well,” former District Court Judge David Harvey tells the Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey, who retired from the court in 2016 to become the founding director of Auckland University’s Centre for ICT Law, consulted with the Law Commission on the Harmful Digital Communications Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Netsafe fielded a record 4207 reports of digital harm, as complaints jumped by around a quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think that is part and parcel of the sort of dislocated society that we’re living in at the moment,” Harvey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The <b>Covid</b> world that we’re living in has created a whole lot of stresses. Part of it, of course, has been, ‘Don’t come into the office, work from home.’ And naturally, as a result of that people are going to be using online services more frequently, both for business and recreation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re going to engage with social media platforms, as part and parcel of that, and get involved in arguments, some of which escalate and become nasty. So there are going to be more complaints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And I think people are far more sensitive these days as well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal, cultural perspectiveNetsafe’s previous CEO, Martin Cocker, came to the organisation after various sales, marketing and management roles in the IT industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carey did a law degree at Victoria, graduating in 1999, and had roles with various justice, dispute resolution and public policy roles across the Tasman before returning to <b>NZ</b> in 2017 to join InternetNZ — where until April he headed the Domain Name Commission. More broadly, In 2020, he completed a leadership programme at <span class="companylink">Oxford University</span>. And he’s also a co-founder of the Carey family company Green Meadows Beef, based in Taranaki. His iwi is Te Āti Awa. He also sits on the executive of Rainbow Wellington — a role that helps add perspective for Netsafe’s annual Netsafety Week, kicking off today, which this week has a “Diversity Matters” theme and events and includes women’s networking events, and includes panels and seminars that will discuss keeping LGBTQIA+, Maori and neurologically diverse communities safe online (see the full lineup here).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Carey’s legal and regulatory experience help?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry says Cocker’s performance as Netsafe head was one of the key reasons that the non-profit — which had already been operating for more than a decade, in an education role — was selected as the lead agency for the Harmful Digital Communications Act (under National, in 2015, as the original legislation was passed. It was reappointed by Labour in June last year).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Overly defensive’ With the case that resulted in the $100,000 payout to three women for privacy breaches, Harvey says Netsafe became “overly defensive” and “blurred the lines” of its roles as the case dragged on. (Many of the details of the case are suppressed — but it involved “Mr Z” turning the tables on three women who had accused him of harassment by taking a case against them to Netsafe, then using an abbreviated version of Netsafe’s case summary as part of the grounds for action he took against the women in the District Court. The women were not given access to the case summary.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The problem, as I see it from the way in which the case unfolded with the Human Rights Review Tribunal [which assessed complaints arising from the District Court action], was that it appeared Netsafe had blurred the lines between its advice-giving and education role, and its statutory duties under the Harmful Digital Communications Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Netsafe needs to be very, very clear in defining the role that it performs as the approved agency. Those lines should not be crossed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netsafe’s opposition to the defendants’ request for discovery revealed, “There were issues they hadn’t really thought through sufficiently because of this blurring of the roles,” Henry says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My view is that I think Mr Z manipulated the process to his own advantage,” Harvey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As the civil proceedings went on — they went on for a long time. I think Netsafe just became more and more defensive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Powers too limited?The ruling in the case of Mr Z and three women also highlighted Netsafe’s very limited powers of investigation as a non-profit, non-government organisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey stands by NetSafe’s appointment. In fact, he sees it as integral to the legislation that its lead agency is a neutral player, independent of the police, the Department of Internal Affairs and other government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carey calls it an “independent umpire” role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey adds, “The model that was put forward was one to have an approved agency as to serve a number of purposes. One was to see if complaints or concerns could be ironed out by negotiation or mediation between a producer of content and a potential victim, and otherwise to act as a filter system so that the courts wouldn’t be flooded with a whole lot of vexatious or pointless applications that had absolutely no merit or substance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solution ignoredCases Netsafe can’t resolve get escalated to the District Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Harvey does see a real problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says it’s crucial that cases of cyber-bullying or harassment are resolved quickly, but the District Court process is slow and drawn out, once you’ve finally made your way to the front of the queue (various hearings involving the three women took place between 2017 and 2019, and it was not until March this year that the $100,000 payout was ordered).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the consultation phase for HDCA, Harvey suggested a Communications Tribunal. It would be presided over by a District Court Judge, but follow a Copyright Tribunal-style model of quick turnaround hearings to “provide citizens harmed by digital communications with speedy, efficient and cheap access to remedies such as takedown orders and ‘cease and desist’ notices”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We [Harvey and the Law Commission] recommended a communications tribunal and Collins [then Justice Minister Judith Collins], when she got the ministerial briefing paper and referred the matter to Cabinet said, ‘No, we don’t need a Communications Tribunal. This should go to the District Court [and] become part of the District Court process.’ That was a mistake.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with <b>mental health</b> and addiction needs will have better access to <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> vaccinations, other immunisations and health checks thanks to grants from a $2 million fund, the National Director of Te Whatu Ora - Health <b>New Zealand</b>'s National Public Health Service, Dr Nick Chamberlain has announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> Vaccine and Immunisation Peer Support Fund has awarded 14 grants to 19 Peer Support organisations across Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>. Peer support workers have lived experience of <b>mental health</b> needs and addiction, helping them build connections with people experiencing <b>mental health</b> and addiction needs and their whānau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People with <b>mental health</b> and addiction needs have a higher risk of getting seriously sick from <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>, and it is important they are able to easily access vaccinations to protect themselves and their whānau," says Dr Chamberlain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As well as focusing on increasing the uptake of <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> vaccinations, the funding also enables a holistic approach to each person's health and wellbeing needs, supporting access to other preventative services such as health checks and influenza vaccinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Significant work has already been done to ensure the vaccination rollout meets the needs of these communities, including setting up vaccination centres with low sensory options, providing support for people with anxiety and needle phobia, and organising accessible transport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, there is still work to be done. These grants will strengthen some of the vital community and sector-led Peer Support services that have proven effective through the <b>COVID</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The grants will be used for a range of initiatives, including setting up helplines, establishing new community outreach programmes, and providing transport to get people to vaccination clinics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to acknowledge and thank the <b>mental health</b> and addiction sector for their efforts supporting vaccinations for this important group," says Dr Chamberlain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Health worked with the <b>Mental Health</b> and Addictions sector to establish the new fund, with particular support from Platform Trust, the Equally Well collective and Te Pou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund's focus on initiatives involving Peer Support workers follows a key recommendation of He Ara Oranga: The Report of the Government Enquiry into <b>Mental Health</b> and Addiction. He Ara Oranga recommended strengthening the role that can be played in the sector by people with lived experience of <b>mental health</b> and addiction issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> Vaccine and Immunisation Peer Support Fund has awarded grants to the following organisations:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another excerpt from her new book, Stuff writer Andrea Vance looks at the moments of crisis leading up to Todd Muller's resignation as National Party leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--------------------</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hamish Walker episode left Todd Muller bruised and exhausted. His <b>mental health</b> was crumbling. "We didn't see his absolute stress," former National MP Lawrence Yule says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Once I asked him how it was going. He said: 'I go from white-hot fear to everything's brilliant. And everything in between.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muller was tipped into crisis the weekend after [Clutha-Southland MP] Walker's resignation. Those around him point to different events over those days that ratcheted up the pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The thing that I think broke the camel's back was <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> and the smelter," one staffer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Anglo-Australian mining giant was again threatening to close its aluminium smelter at Tiwai Point on the southern coast of the South Island, putting more than 1000 jobs in Bluff and Invercargill on the line. The smelter is also the biggest consumer of electricity, using roughly 13% of the country's power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> had previously threatened to close operations, and it was widely viewed as a tactic in negotiating for a cut- price electricity deal in an election year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[National Party deputy leader] Nikki [Kaye] was convinced that it was real and that National should ride to the rescue," a staffer says. She wanted Muller to fly to Invercargill, meet the workers and promise they'd keep their jobs under a National government. Gerry Brownlee, as a former energy minister, adviser Tim Hurdle and [communications consultant] Matthew Hooton, who had previously held <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> as a client, advised against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hurdle had this line: Don't get between the Government and a problem. They all said we should shut up and let the government explain why all these people lose their jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kaye was insistent. "The woman just keeps going," another staffer says. "It's a double-edged sword. Where others would give up because it was hopeless, Nikki keeps going. And that became a problem. There were nine of us versus Nikki."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muller said he must back his deputy. "Normally it's the other way around," the staffer sighs. Hurdle was sent home to come up with a speech and a policy. Hooton was ordered to start working on a speech on Chris Bishop's new transport infrastructure policy for Auckland, which was to be delivered on Monday. Muller also went north, to spend time with his in-laws in the east Auckland suburb Stonefields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insiders point to Kaye and Hooton's volatile relationship as the tipping point. "They clashed like f...ery. It was incredible," one aide says. Both rang Muller to complain, and both threatened to quit. The leader, already under extreme pressure, had to mollify and arbitrate between them both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others put the blame on Kaye's decision to front for a television interview to explain the Walker saga. It was Muller who was invited to appear on TVNZ's Q+A. He declined, recognising there was no upside to another interrogation of what he knew about the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> patient leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His answers would be sliced and diced into sound bites, dragging the story out into the high-rating evening news bulletin. Kaye saw it differently. Ignoring advice from advisers and Brownlee, and a direct order from Muller, she fronted up to the show. The appearance was, as one MP put it, "a s... show".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaye was forced to deny that National had once again embroiled itself in "dirty politics". She faced questions about what she'd been told by [former party president] Michelle Boag, and the links to her re-election campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back, she defended her decision: "Todd was having time with his family and that was the message I had. I had committed to it . . . and I thought it was really important to talk through what had occurred, and that is the way I have always operated in my political career: to front up. I think that's the right thing to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muller could no longer cope: "In the end the frequency and intensity of the panic attacks took me to a place where I had to step away from the fire, the anxiety and the pain." As one staffer says: "That weekend everything just melted down, for everybody."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calls and emails to Muller went unanswered. The team suspected he was suffering a nervous breakdown and cancelled the policy launch, citing a stomach bug. [Muller's chief of staff] Megan Campbell flew to Auckland to see what she could do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brownlee was in Napier campaigning with Katie Nimon, a well-thought-of candidate who was challenging Labour's Stuart Nash. After a long day on the hustings, Nimon and Brownlee joined former Hawke's Bay ministers Chris Tremain and Craig Foss, and local MP Yule, for craft beers at the Westshore Beach Inn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4pm Brownlee's phone rang. It was Campbell to say Muller had suffered "an incident" and would be relinquishing the leadership. Brownlee said, "Aw, he's just tired," and flew immediately to Auckland to try and talk him around. "It was a pretty broken situation," the staffer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campbell and Brownlee worked long into the night drafting a press release announcing Muller's resignation, effective from the following morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has become clear to me that I am not the best person to be leader of the opposition and leader of the <b>New Zealand</b> National Party at this critical time for <b>New Zealand</b>," it said. "It is more important than ever that the <b>New Zealand</b> National Party has a leader who is comfortable in the role. The role has taken a heavy toll on me personally, and on my family, and this has become untenable from a health perspective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A conference call was held to inform a small inner circle, sometime after 9pm on Monday. Muller did not attend. The rest of the party was blindsided when the news was made public at 7.30am on Tuesday. Kaye and Adams followed, both resigning on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It drew a line under a chaotic 53 days within the leader's office. The party was again thrown into turmoil and the MPs were furious. "I remember thinking: it is all over. Why don't we just concede right now?" a senior MP says. "Todd will justify it in all sorts of ways, but he has got no concept of how much damage that did to so many people who were working so hard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another MP says it was a deeply stressful time. "Todd didn't look like he was enjoying it. You have got to want the job, and he overworked himself or he let himself be overworked." An MP loyal to Simon Bridges rages: "The problems for us started with Jami-Lee Ross. Then we had a coup that should never have happened."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just 67 days until polling closed, senior party figures and MPs began calling the person they believed to be their only viable alternative. A caucus meeting was hastily organised in Wellington. At the eleventh hour, Judith Collins was ready to take the job she had coveted for almost 20 years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a bit of theatre, a bit of fun, and it'll look good on their CVs, but the triennial Youth Parliament is more than that - it's a reminder of the importance of youth voices in public debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past two days, 139 young people - representing <b>New Zealand</b>'s 120 MPs and youth press gallery members - descended on Wellington to try their hand at Parliamentary debate and mock-lawmaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It'd be easy to write this off as tokenism; a fun extracurricular project for high-achievers. But the issues raised and the calibre of debate should give adults - and indeed our actual MPs - reason to pause and listen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when future-focused issues like climate change, <b>mental health</b> and democratic participation are on the agenda, the views of young people play a crucial role in helping shape societal thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luke Orbell, youth MP for Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, proudly stood in his korowai to speak about the impacts of colonisation: "The worst thing to happen to this country".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He talked about how his culture, language and whakapapa was stolen from him, from his father, and his father's father.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pepeha he delivered in the debating chamber was one he'd learnt just five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm angry. I'm angry that the pepeha was stolen from me," Orbell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the other 119 youth MPs, those watching from the public gallery - including Ngarewa-Packer and fellow Maori Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi - gave Orbell a lengthy standing ovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday morning, the MPs ushered a mock bill through Parliament, voting in favour of abolishing the starting out wage, which those supporting the mock bill say perpetuates age-based discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debates touched on numerous topics currently being debated by Parliament proper: the loss of young talent to overseas in the so-called post- <b>Covid</b> brain drain, worker exploitation, the <b>pandemic</b>'s impact on unemployment, and the rising cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When speaking in favour of the Minimum Wage (Starting-Out Wage Abolition) Amendment Bill, Daisy Tumataroa said Aotearoa didn't want to lose any more young people to overseas shores for better pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Leaders of the future" should no longer be used for cheap labour, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Simon O'Connor's youth representative Megan Cartwright pointed out that "youth have always been disproportionately affected when the going gets tough", referencing the global financial crisis and the disproportionate impact <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> has had on the youth unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the week, the young MPs threw their weight behind the "Make It 16" campaign, asking lawmakers to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote in both local body and general elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engagement, enthusiasm and care of this bunch seems a pretty strong argument in favour of allowing young people to participate more fully in society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacinda Ardern's youth MP William Bell-Purchas summed it up when he said: "Young people are educated enough and competent enough to be able to make that choice and vote in their elections."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phone calls to PlunketLine concerning maternal <b>mental health</b> have tripled in two years, but the number of women accessing care has gone down, National's <b>Mental Health</b> &amp; Suicide Prevention spokesperson Matt Doocey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite Labour investing $1.9 billion to expand <b>mental health</b> services, we have seen a drop in women accessing care regarding maternal <b>mental health</b> challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New figures show a staggering 197 per cent increase in calls to PlunketLine. In the quarter beginning 1 October 2019, PlunketLine received 334 calls, but this had jumped to 992 by the same quarter in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is deeply concerning as data from the Ministry of Health shows that access to Perinatal and Infant <b>Mental Health</b> care is at a steady decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<b>Covid</b>-related stress has caused postnatal and perinatal depression rates to soar, and maternal <b>mental health</b> services are struggling to keep up with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should not see reduced access to services when $1.9 billion has been allocated to address these issues. Where has this money gone, and why has it not made a difference?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This Government has entirely overlooked maternal <b>mental health</b>; even after a review into maternal <b>mental health</b> services, we are yet to see an up-to-date framework for this part of the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The solution to our <b>mental health</b> crisis is not throwing more money at it. The issue concerns leadership, creating a shared vision, and being accountable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This Government is great at making announcements but utterly incapable of delivering improved outcomes."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government says that the 25 cent cut in fuel tax will cost it a total of more than $1 billion. This is incorrect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many months last year, before the Ukraine invasion, we were paying a high of around $2.20-$2.30 per litre of 91 fuel. Just before it took the 25 cents off, we were paying around $3.30 per litre, indeed we would be paying around that now if it wasn’t for the tax reduction. That is about $1 more per litre than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extra tax take, in round figures, would therefore be about 50 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government has given us a 25 cent reduction, but it is still 25 cents better off. Surely, if it says it will lose more than $1 billion from the tax cut, in actual fact, the total extra tax take would have been more than $2 billion and it would still be around $1 billion better off if the petrol price had stayed at $2.30 per litre?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realise these are very approximate figures, but the point I am making is that the Government is still far better off with the high petrol prices and a 25 cent tax reduction, than if prices had remained around $2.30 per litre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Jones, Te Atatū Peninsula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding fuel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As unprecedented heat waves threaten the UK, Europe and the US with another early wildfire season, we extend the fuel subsidy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long as Western, rich nations continue subsidising fuel, we will never change our driving behaviour. As worldwide demand stays the same, the high cost of oil will remain. Governments of nations who can’t afford the subsidies, face riots and topple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much pain must the world endure before we give up one iota of convenience and comfort?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Swney, Morrinsville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People power</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Keith Turner’s assessment of increasing green power generation (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 16) is too conservative but it is interesting to note how much we rely on and benefit from investments made many years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have to at least aim to double green energy output in the next 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within five years, most new cars will be electric, but, more important, the option of buying hydrogen engines (by combustion) to replace diesel engines will be readily available. To be able to change to hydrogen we have to aim for a cost price for production of hydrogen per kg of between <b>NZ</b>$3-$4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsidising new car purchases, supporting overseas investors or exporting hydrogen will not achieve this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A green energy strategy has to be established, the regulatory environment has to be changed to build an integrated supply and demand system where anybody can contribute or benefit. Money received from fuel ETS should be used for the transformation to green energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green power is not only about big power stations, but also about a huge amount of small contributors. The changes we have to make are not for the next 20 years but for the next 50 to 100 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Kaelin, Te Awamutu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s face it</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, a doctor has written of the importance of wearing masks to reduce the spread of the Omicron virus. Dr Hylton Le Grice (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 18) has reiterated what has been said over and over again but even though free medical masks are now available it’s doubtful that will make much difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s really hard to understand why some people are still choosing to believe information regularly trotted out on social media by ill-informed people who are either down the rabbit hole of nonsense or are hopping around the edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lorraine Kidd, Warkworth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiting room</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national average of emergency department wait-times has risen from 270 to 287 minutes in the past year (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 18).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the enormous and increasing pressures experienced by all parts of the health services at this time, I think an increased wait time of only 17 minutes is outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My thanks to all members of the health services — pre-hospital care ambulance staff, primary care services, and hospital staff — who are making a huge contribution to help manage this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your article also included criticism of Health Minister Andrew Little and the new health reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those reforms are needed now — these changes, coupled with all current efforts to increase staffing as quickly as possible, will make for an improved health service for all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Huggard, Ostend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have faith</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I take exception to DB Smith’s letter (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 18) stating that Christopher Luxon — among others — have religious baggage because they have the audacity to be pro-life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, is Smith aiming at all faiths or just the Christian faith?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems we are becoming a nation that promotes freedom of expression but is intolerant on certain issues. One of these, of course, is abortion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am fully in the pro-life camp and am thankful to be a fully committed Christian. If this makes me full of religious baggage, then praise God for that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I feel obliged to respond to Clyde Scott’s letter (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 18 ).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He correctly complimented the Herald’s editorials as being trustworthy. He then goes on to talk about <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we now have two pulpits of truth — the Herald editorials and what were the daily briefings by Jacinda and Ashley, now a more simple and less dramatic daily update.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your correspondent seems to suggest that we should look no further for fear of being misinformed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I for one refer to all sides of a discussion and form my own opinions, having discarded mischievous and misleading commentary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reading Scott’s letter, for example, I got one side of the argument but was left wondering why he made no reference to negatives such as the effect on children kept away from friends and from school, <b>mental health</b> problems, looming economic carnage, small business failures, to name a few results from excessive lockdowns and other mandates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moral to this is that there are always two sides to any story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is why we have our letters to the Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Clerk, Meadowbank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World view</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your correspondent Clyde Scott seems happy to believe that the <b>New Zealand Covid</b> result has been “the best in the world”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, the <b>NZ</b> death rate, at 357 per million, is less than half the world average which is good but is more than others such as Taiwan, Japan and Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 220 countries have reported <b>Covid</b> deaths and 78 of those countries report fewer deaths per million than <b>NZ</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger Russell, Castor Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stoking inflation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here we have the National Party criticising the Government for continuing to stoke inflation by giving people more money to spend through its “handouts” of half-price public transport, continuation of its reduction in fuel taxes and additional payments per week to those who earn less than $70,000 per annum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the National Party once again talks about tax cuts. Isn’t that the same i.e. putting additional money in the hands of citizens?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except the biggest tax cuts they have proposed are for those who don’t need them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where is the good sense in that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Hood, Hamilton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game-changer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty years ago, rugby was the major game of <b>New Zealand</b>, white South Africa, and the English public schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professionalism changed that, and now with the best players earning massive sums, rugby is more widely played and recognised as a major sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men and women with the size and speed necessary for the modern game, and with a taste for hard physical contact have joined this entertaining sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> was once one of the major players in a minor sport, but those days may be over; our population is too small for us to be continually competitive on a world scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopefully, we will occasionally have a group of outstanding individuals who, like the Black Caps can beat the other teams that will always have a greater pool to choose from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe that is not the case in 2022.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finds Business Finances A Key Driver Of <b>Mental Wellbeing</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A first-of-its-kind <span class="companylink">BDO</span> study investigating the link between business performance and <b>mental wellbeing</b> has found that financial challenges have been a key driver of business leaders and owners feeling less mentally healthy than normal over the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half (44%) of the business leaders and owners who responded to the inaugural BDO Wellbeing in Business Index - Te Rangahau o ngā hauora pai - stated that they had been feeling less mentally healthy than normal at some time in the past six months. Of these, 36% said business' financial performance challenges - including cash flow problems - were causing this. This was the leading concern behind general impacts of <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> (45%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">External economic and political factors, workload, employee conflict and performance and a lack of people to rely on for support were also factors causing negative wellbeing to be mentioned by respondents to the survey - conducted among nearly 600 business leaders and owners across Aotearoa during late May 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism, retail and healthcare businesses have the lowest <b>mental wellbeing</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly two-thirds (61%) of business leaders and owners said they were feeling better compared to when <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> was at its peak disruption. However, one-third said they felt about the same. There were significant differences across industries, with only 32% of tourism businesses saying they felt better (56% said the same).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey adopted the <span class="companylink">World Health Organisation</span>'s internationally recognised "WHO-5' wellbeing index to take a snapshot of wellbeing among <b>New Zealand</b> business owners. The WHO-5 asks respondents to rate how they have been feeling in the past two weeks across five key statements, and calculates a score ranging from 0 (representing the worst possible wellbeing) to 100 (representing the best possible wellbeing).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole-of-business average WHO-5 score was 69 at the time of surveying, suggesting that - while the past two years have been difficult - there was potentially a degree of resilience among business leaders and owners. Again, there were significant industry variations - retail scored the lowest WHO-5 score of 56, while second lowest was healthcare (60), and third lowest was tourism (63). Retail, healthcare and tourism have continued to face significant disruption from <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>. Construction scored the highest (82) followed by agriculture (80). Given that the WHO-5 score is a point-in-time measure and wellbeing fluctuates over time, it will be key to track these sector trends in future reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Positive future outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also asked respondents how they might expect to feel about their business performance and wellbeing in six months' time. Encouragingly, 71% said that they expect to feel positive about their business performance, while 73% said they expected to feel generally satisfied by life most or all of the time. Again, <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>, workload and financial problems were expected to be the main drivers of negative wellbeing. Those citing cash flow problems increased to 22%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flexible work and strong financial management key to maintaining wellbeing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked what business leaders do in their business to manage their wellbeing, flexible working came top. Second was managing boundaries between work and home, while strong financial management processes came third. This included creating a cash flow management plan, reviewing accounts regularly, and closely following a business plan and strategy. Ranking fourth was delegating tasks when workload is too high, while seeking business advice from trusted people came fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gina Cook, BDO Advisory Partner, said: "My clients who fared best through <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> were the ones who were the most financially prepared before they went into the <b>pandemic</b>. Having a solid business plan, detailed financial projections, understanding where your cash is coming from, what your monthly expenditure is, what your working capital cycle is - all these things enable businesses to navigate much more easily when unexpected events happen. Owners with strong financial processes will also likely have a much stronger relationship with their lenders, meaning businesses can much more easily access additional resources when needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their personal life, regular exercise, getting enough sleep and spending time socialising with friends and family all scored highly as key methods to keep wellbeing in a good space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Haines, <span class="companylink">BDO</span> Deputy Chair, said: "In working closely with businesses across Aotearoa, we often see first-hand the challenges they're facing in terms of business performance and their wellbeing. While we're not the wellbeing experts, we know finances are a key driver here, as was borne out in the survey - and our goal is to combine our insights from this unique study with our financial know-how to help take away some of the stress of running a business."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Inquiry Reveals Thousands Of Students Living In Poverty</span>
</div><div class="author">Green Party </div><div>1028 words</div><div>19 July 2022</div><div>05:14</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government must lift student incomes now, says the Green Party, as new evidence shows thousands of students are living in poverty, with many struggling to pay rent and put food on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone in this country deserves to live a life of dignity. Our new research shows that's a right denied to thousands of students. Political decisions over the last few decades have normalised and entrenched student poverty. This wasn't an accident. It can be fixed," says Green Party spokesperson for tertiary education Chlöe Swarbrick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the People's Inquiry into Student Wellbeing (embargoed copy attached) were released today by the Green Party and NZUSA, Te Mana Ākonga, Tauira Pasifika and the National Disabled Students' Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the more than 4,500 students who responded:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, those living in a shared flat spend 56% of their weekly income on rent. 91% support rent controls and 82% support a rental warrant of fitness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of students regularly do not have enough money to buy food, clothing, pay bills, get health care or other basics. Disabled, Māori and Pasifika students were most likely to be in that position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in six students said their shared flat didn't meet their needs but couldn't move because rents were too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds haven't been able to pay for transport or the costs of a vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">91% said they would use public transport "more" if it was free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most students (69%) reported a decline in <b>mental wellbeing</b> during the <b>COVID</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>, and some said this negatively impacted their studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Education is a public good. We all benefit when somebody takes on tertiary study, contributes original thought and their skills to our communities, country and world," says Chlöe Swarbrick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yet students are struggling, significantly. The minority of students who today can access the allowance are in real terms hundreds of dollars worse off a month than students even a decade ago, which is nothing on when education was effectively free prior to the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We opened this Inquiry when it was clear neither the Government nor the supposed opposition were interested in the real data or experiences of students on the ground. We said it would give us irrefutable evidence of the systemic barriers and challenges facing the 400,000 students in this country. It has. This must force change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Students who rent on average spend 56% of their income on mostly damp, cold flats. Internationally and locally accepted "affordability' measurements declare no one should be spending more than 30% of their income on housing. We need affordable, healthy homes for everyone, and students overwhelmingly understand the need for rent controls and a warrant of fitness for rental homes - because they live in a world without those fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While politicians have spent decades internationally undermining student voice and trading their well-being off for short-term cost savings, students are waking up to their power. It's time for a Universal Student Allowance, fees-free, free public transport, rent controls and a rental WOF. The only thing standing in our way is mainstream political willpower - and there's an election next year," says Chlöe Swarbrick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;h2&gt;NZUSA says "broken promises' harming students&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our People's Inquiry, released today, shows how broken promises from politicians can harm the lives of students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students live in poverty. We know this to be true, and we have had the lived experience for thirty years. But the results from our People's Inquiry demonstrate just how stark this poverty is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poverty should never be a "rite of passage' to suffer through. Thank you to the more than 4,500 students who have given us an unparalleled opportunity to change these systems for the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Education is a right, not a privilege. We have an obligation to ensure that all students are able to live while studying, and this inquiry has proved that students are struggling to make ends meet. Postgrad students were promised by Chris Hipkins that the allowance would be extended to them, however he has broken his word," says National Vice President of the <b>New Zealand</b> Union of Students' Associations, Sam Blackmore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Payments to students need to be accessible and liveable. They should be provided regardless of how much part-time income that a student may make out of necessity to supplement themselves - especially in a cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A Universal Education Income, a weekly payment to every student regardless of level of study, age, or parental income would help students meet day to day costs and reduce long term debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This Government introduced a Code of Pastoral Care to support learner wellbeing. But they aren't prepared to meet it themselves, through realistic and simple policy change. The Government needs to now embed and enforce this Code of Practice in full, and not bend to compromising student safety in the roll out of such an important policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"$25million to student <b>mental health</b> does not go far enough to cover the shortages in trained staff who actually provide the support to students. Yet another example of setting up expectations in the Code that the Government is not prepared to meet in their own policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Accessibility to our places of learning is paramount to student wellbeing and providing barrier free access to education. The Government has seen the success of the public transport subsidy over the last few months. They could be bold and go one simple step further and remove this barrier entirely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our Prime Minister states that "education is the greatest enabler in society' and promised a free tertiary education system to improve the lives of students just 5 years ago. Yet today, through deliberate political choices and distinct inaction, students remain some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, living in an environment that makes them sick through mould and cold, while eating 2-minute noodles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By investing in our students now, we can establish a society that will not allow anyone to endure living through a period of brutal transient poverty while they study" says Sam Blackmore.</p>

</div><div class="author">Te Whatu Ora Health <b>New Zealand</b> </div><div>737 words</div><div>18 July 2022</div><div>12:22</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rising cases of <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and influenza (flu) put increasing pressure on Taranaki's health services, Te Whatu Ora Taranaki and its community providers are strongly urging the community to get fully vaccinated against <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and flu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gill Campbell, Te Whatu Ora Taranaki interim district director says, "We are seeing cases and hospital admissions increase week on week. The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) surveillance testing of people admitted to hospital with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) over the last three weeks shows around 20% are due to <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and more than 50% are due to flu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of patients being admitted to hospital with the flu are very sick with Influenza A H3, including three people needing ICU care," says Campbell. "This is one of four strains included in the 2022 flu vaccine which reiterates the all-important message that getting the flu jab is quite literally the best protection we have against contracting this serious illness."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are also increasing reports of people not testing for <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>, reporting RAT tests late, or not reporting them at all. This is resulting in many people not getting the medical and social supports they need, when they need it. Instead they are getting so sick they are needing avoidable medical intervention putting pressure on our stretched health services."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severe illness requiring hospital admission is avoidable for most people via vaccination. Primary care data shows that around 70% of those aged 65 years and older have received a flu vaccine this year. However, this means there is a significant portion of the community - nearly 30% - who are at higher risk that remain partially vaccinated, or not vaccinated at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Catherine Jackson, Te Whatu Ora Taranaki medical officer of health says, "In Taranaki, the risk of a <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> admission for Māori and Pacific adults over 45 years is at least double the risk of that for people of other ethnicities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more layers of protection we put in place - particularly vaccinations, but also mask wearing, washing your hands, social distancing and staying home from work and school if you're māuiui/sick - the more we can reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses," says Jackson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If people have had <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and at least three months have passed since their infection, they can now get their next free vaccination. With cases continuing to increase in <b>New Zealand</b>, we're heading towards a second Omicron wave, so being fully vaccinated and boosted is especially important."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second boosters are now available to high-risk groups, with additional vaccine brands available of <span class="companylink">Novavax</span> and <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca</span> - the latter via prescription. Free flu vaccination has also been extended to children aged 3-12 years and people with severe <b>mental health</b> or addiction needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immunising children aged 3-12 years against the flu not only reduces their risk of getting it, but also reduces the risk of them passing it on to their whānau, which is so important when it comes to infants, older whānau, and whānau with pre-existing illnesses safe from serious illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Smith, Pinnacle GP leader says, "In the last month we have seen schools experience huge absences due to <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and flu and this of course has had a flow-on effect on our practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All of this illness is additional to their usual workload, and with the flu due to peak in the coming weeks, the pressure on general practices is really mounting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're working closely with Te Whatu Ora Taranaki to help limit the spread of respiratory illnesses like flu and <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and ease the load on the healthcare community. We absolutely support the calls for vaccination and encourage people to continue to wear a face mask, even if you're fully vaccinated as it's an effective tool in keeping you, your whānau and your community safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who needs a flu, <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> or Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination should visit their GP, pharmacy, or Māori health provider. They can also drop into the New Plymouth and Hāwera Vaccination Centres (open every day), or one the many Winter Wellness Clinics happening every week in communities throughout Taranaki.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an exhaustive international search, Te Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington has appointed a successor to Grant Guilford, who retired after eight years as vice-chancellor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internationally renowned scholar Professor Nic Smith will swap the golden beaches of Queensland, where he works as provost at the state's university of technology, for the slightly less glamorous and imported sand of Oriental Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it wasn't the scale, pace or climate of Wellington that drew him here. Rather, it was the opportunity to come to this university in particular - one that was "creative and energetic and diverse".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smith, who won't start his tenure in Wellington until mid- January, has run up an impressive - if not slightly intimidating - list of academic credentials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was a Professor of Computational Physiology at Oxford, before becoming head of biomedical engineering at King's College London, and then returned to <b>New Zealand</b> to head the Faculty of Engineering at the <span class="companylink">University of Auckland</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria University is the capital's second-largest employer. In the past two years, a controversial restructure was scrapped after backlash from staff and students and an internal report showed more than half of its staff were feeling stressed, fatigued and anxious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A later survey showed staff had low confidence in senior leaders, and only four months later, the emotional toll of the <b>pandemic</b> was only exacerbated by the Parliament occupation on the doorstep of its Pipitea campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Staff have done extraordinary things at this university," Smith said. "In many cases, they have taken on additional duties, either because colleagues have been out with <b>Covid</b> [. . . ] or because we've had to expand the way in which things have been delivered, online and in person."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smith has been meeting with staff and students over the past few days and hearing there were "enormous amounts going on". On top of the uncertainty of <b>Covid</b>, it was wearing people down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you hold on to everything, and everything is important, then you run the risk of nothing being important."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, student <b>mental health</b> has been in dire straits, with universities "noticing a sustained and definite increase in those reporting mental distress".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's been really good work here done, but I don't for a minute think that that work is finished," Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising living costs were hitting students hard and the university was also feeling the pinch. "The revenue which is used to provide for [assistance for students] is shrinking in real terms."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking long term, Smith wanted to head a university which was "a gateway to an increasingly connected but also increasingly challenging world".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One that delivers not only a disciplinary training, but also provides the kind of lifelong learning skills of resilience, which I think this generation is going to have to deal with."</p>

</div><div>634 words</div><div>16 July 2022</div><div>Dominion Post</div><div>DOMPOS</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>© 2022 Fairfax New Zealand Limited. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'C risis? What crisis?" According to political legend, that headline, in The Sun newspaper in 1979, sealed the fate of British prime minister James Callaghan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the winter of discontent. Everyone from gravediggers to rubbish collectors had been on strike. Callaghan returned to a freezing Britain from a summit in the warm Caribbean and disputed the notion his country was in the grip of "mounting chaos".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The headline followed. A general election four months later removed Callaghan and Labour from office, and installed Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newspaper nerds and history buffs might have been reminded of that scene this week when Health Minister Andrew Little stubbornly refused to use the word "crisis" to describe a stretched, challenged and embattled health system in the grip of a perfect storm of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, winter flu and unusually high workforce shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Little kept being asked to label it a crisis and kept resisting, while searching for less damning synonyms, interviews became farcical and started to detract from the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little claimed last month that our hospitals are under "very significant pressure" but are still coping. That annoyed many in the sector who feel he has downplayed the crisis, as they see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an open letter to Little, the <b>New Zealand</b> Association of General Surgeons asked for "public acknowledgement of the gravity of the situation and the fact that this is not a temporary winter/flu/<b>Covid</b>- related problem". The association had no hesitation in calling it a health workforce crisis. It also disputed Little's suggestion that this is just an unusually bad winter, as that leads "the public to believe that the health workforce problem will self-resolve when the sun starts shining", and "we all know this isn't the case".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another open letter, from the <b>New Zealand</b> Women in Medicine Charitable Trust, agreed we are facing a crisis, and went further still. Its survey of more than 900 respondents in 30 sub- specialties found "we are at risk of a catastrophic collapse of the healthcare workforce".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust also said "the <b>pandemic</b> has exposed longstanding staffing issues, rather than being the cause".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may offer a clue to Little's reluctance to call it a crisis. If he was to agree with these bodies, he would have to accept their assessment of an under-resourced and demoralised workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A coincidence of two viruses in winter can seem like an act of God, beyond any government's control. But the deeper, structural problems underpinning the crisis cannot be shrugged off in the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a way in which calling something a crisis is a political game. It is a red alert setting that gets everyone's attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oppositions will always try to embarrass governments into using the word rather than more palatable variations. Labour cannot complain about the current run of crisis-talk, given it claimed there were crises in both <b>mental health</b> and housing when it was last in opposition. Just for variety, Labour's Phil Twyford also wanted to declare "a state of emergency" over housing. Then National prime minister John Key was unwilling to agree with Labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another way to respond. Rather than resisting or denying, a politician could accept the label and act accordingly. After a few days of hearing the Opposition talk about a cost-of-living crisis in March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern conceded and announced some temporary measures, including a petrol excise cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agreeing with the Opposition, and the growing chorus in the media, took some sting out of the criticism. After all, it wasn't just the winter of discontent that undid Callaghan in 1979. It was the sense that he was out of touch in his refusal to admit it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After interviewing more than 500 parents in six countries, Kiwi academic Dr Ellen Nelson explains why Kiwi businesses should ditch the 9-5 work day</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are in the middle of the Great Resignation, a global <b>pandemic</b>, a <b>mental health</b> crisis, great advances in technology and an uprising to address social inequities, not to mention that <b>New Zealand</b> is not doing so flash on the productivity front. With the war on talent well under way, I am convinced there is a better way to do work; a way that is both commercially and socially smart: #workschoolhours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After my PhD research, which focused on leadership, wellbeing and the experiences of women in the workforce, I conducted an informal piece of research about the experiences of working parents — my data is from more than 500 parents across a variety of roles and sectors in <b>New Zealand</b>, <b>Australia</b>, UK, US, Canada and Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I found is not a surprise. In fact, what I found is what every single parent knows to be true: managing work and family is tough. Parents either (a) cannot make work work, and so leave the paid workforce, (b) work full-time and miss time with their children, or (c) undertake some kind of part-time arrangement which, in almost every circumstance, comes with a reduction in pay, but not a reduction in workload or outputs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a mother of two young children — a 5-year-old and a 1-year-old — none of these three outcomes are satisfactory to me, and I am convinced we can do better. It became clear to me that the root cause of these challenges is the fact that we live in a society where work and school are not aligned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this? Why do we work 9-to-5? Even for people who don’t strictly work 9-to-5, our employment contracts and entire society is fundamentally based off that construct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of the 9-to-5 workday was cemented in our society more than a century ago. At that time, the workforce was comprised mostly of men, and the home force mostly of women. The 9-to-5 is based on the assumption that every household has a dedicated worker and a dedicated caregiver of children. But this does not represent the demographics of the workforce today. Workers and caregivers are the same people. It is absolutely bonkers to me that we have not changed our construct of work to reflect the changing demographics of our workforce and it is bonkers to me that we live in a society where the schedules of adults and children are different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I thought, “here’s a crazy idea: why don’t we reduce the work schedule, to align with the school schedule, without reducing salaries: #workschoolhours”. Not just for parents, for everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is where I get very excited: I know any new way of working needs to be commercially smart, and I am absolutely convinced that #workschoolhours can be. It is about doing more to better align the schedules of adults and children and to provide more personal time for all staff. This is done by focusing more on outputs, what it is we want our staff to deliver, as opposed to their inputs; the hours and location of work. And it focuses on flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concepts such as Parkinson’s Law — which says work expands to fill the time available for its completion — the great traction that Andrew Barnes’ four-day week is getting around the globe, and the hundreds of part-time workers from my research who are still delivering the same workload as their full-time colleagues, all demonstrate there are productivity gains to be made. When we focus more on outputs, we can increase productivity, and get the same amount of work done in less time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a staff wellbeing argument. If all staff, had more personal time outside work to spend with family, or pursue their hobbies, they would be happier, and therefore better focused and better performers when they are at work. This leads to improved organisational performance, and better profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From an attraction and retention point of view, just imagine the calibre of talent you could get to work for your organisation, if you said, “We will never make you feel guilty about your commitments outside work — we care that you do your job well, not when or where you do it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, one of the most impactful things an organisation could do to increase the representation of women in leadership positions, and to unlock the massively under-utilised section of the workforce (mums), is to structure the organisation around school hours, and then normalise this for everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">#workschoolhours is a commercially and socially smart concept. Organisations can start by simply moving all co-working periods inside the school day — no more 4pm team meetings, and by talking with staff to work out how to do things more efficiently to finish work earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To learn more, check out my #workschoolhours talk and other publications on my website: ellenjoannelson.com. The TEDx talk video is due out this year. I run my own business as a consultant, helping organisations improve retention. It comes down to leadership, wellbeing and the future of work.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising cost of living is harming poverty-stricken students, an advocate says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Students who can't afford [it] are not enrolling," <b>New Zealand</b> Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA) president Andrew Lessells said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student unions have called for better support and they will be backing up their demands on Monday, when they release the responses of more than 4500 students to a Green Party-backed survey about wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey is expected to show the gap between student income and the cost of living is growing, with many having to trade off their health and study to make ends meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third-year Massey student Maya Louw knows this better than most. Her previous flat had such a bad borer infestation, the walls took on a lean. She wishes she was kidding. Coupled with mould, no insulation and no natural light, this $840 flat was less than perfect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louw, who was flatting with three of her friends, felt like she had only the scraps to pick from in the rental market. She now lives in a one-bedroom flat for almost $400 a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her main issue is a lack of money and support, despite getting the student living costs loan, working 10 hours a week and getting $140 weekly from her parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louw said that when she compared how much she paid for groceries in the first year with what she paid now, she could not believe she was buying the same items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the cost of filling the trolley continues to climb, with grocery food prices rising 7.6% last month from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Victoria University Te Herenga Waka student Katherine Blow, the housing crisis has hit her at full force, and she is grateful she can share a room with her partner to keep costs down. "I feel like I would barely be able to afford a normal single room market rent, which is like $240 to $250 now," Blow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her previous flat was freezing, had no insulation and no heating provided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her current flat, Blow does not have the protection of the healthy homes standards as she signed her lease before those guidelines took effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said there was no other option - "unless you can afford $300 a week in rent, which is so unrealistic, especially when you are on a low income as a student".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Wellington region, the median weekly rent rose 3 per cent year-on-year to reach $615 in May, according to the latest Trade Me rental data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student living costs gave Blow an extra $280 a week, on top of her pay from 20 hours of work a week. It helped but the problem was with the whole system, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association president Ralph Zambrano is worried divisions between students could grow. "I think we are heading towards a bigger divide between those who have money and those who do not. Especially within our generation and younger generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing an increased number of students going towards hardship fund support."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past three years, especially with <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, more students had been asking for help from hardship funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Victoria University Hardship Fund (Putea Awhina) had 1000 students a year applying for financial support, Zambrano said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria University has recorded a loss of just under 3% in enrolment numbers over the past five years, according to its annual reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acting vice-chancellor Professor Jennifer Windsor said there were various factors affecting current student enrolment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The findings show us that several factors are at play: their <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing; the cost of living; the affordability of lifestyle; and the ability to get work experience for their future careers," Windsor said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With research proving that green space is necessary for <b>mental health</b> and the problems folk are having here now, it concerns me that trees are being taken down and buildings are virtually covering most of the sections being built on now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canvas a week ago, there was an article about a German architect, who was stated to be ahead of his time, who built his high-density housing in a horseshoe facing into a park.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Race relations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Wilson (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 12) is another of <b>New Zealand</b>’s Champagne socialists who thinks that wanting a country of equality is called “racism”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     David Seymour is speaking for a great many New Zealanders who are sick of the division being promoted by this Government and causing many to feel ostracised. Having equality for all New Zealanders is not as he quotes “straight-out racism”. It’s called harmony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John McOviney, Mt Maunganui.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historic context</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reading Simon Wilson’s article (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 12), I felt I had to add my comment. Politicians supposedly targeting the disgruntled among those of European descent seem blissfully ignorant of European constitutional traditions, in particular, the British constitutional traditions <b>New Zealand</b> is allegedly founded on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Crown</span> never owned all the land in the UK. Shakespeare’s histories refer to a land where the <span class="companylink">Crown</span> is merely the largest land-holder, and the King must play nice. Cities held considerable rights on their own account, and the <span class="companylink">Crown</span> had no right to interfere. A man’s house is his castle means exactly that — the Crown and its agents have no automatic right to enter, but must apply, giving good and adequate reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at the Treaty of Waitangi in that light, and Queen Victoria is less overlord and more a UN Secretariat. Things have changed since then of course, but the principle holds — where original title has not been extinguished, the rights belong and must be upheld. It’s bemusing — and amusing — that the people supposedly upholding the European traditions don’t know what they are, or cherry-pick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It calls for satire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wesley Parish, Tauranga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voting provision</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Referring to Simon Wilson’s critique (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 12) of David Seymour and Act, I believe most Kiwis in our multi-ethnic society are happy to observe and respect in good faith all things Māori such as language, Matariki, traditions, Treaty partnership requirements and the like. But what they do not want to be undermined are the fundamental provisions of our valued democracy, i.e. universal suffrage and one person one vote at all levels of national and local government. There is a danger that the two threads may become mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The onus is on our political masters to design their social engineering legislation to ensure this cannot happen. This Labour Government is on dangerous ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derek Smith, Newmarket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Positives accentuated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no mention of Act’s anti-co-governance petition at the public revelations of policy last weekend. Could it be because Act’s last update reported just 10,000 signatures, less than 0.03 per cent of the population?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anti-Three Waters petition by another organisation that would also scotch the Matariki holiday has done marginally better, with 100,000 signatures, about the same small number that opposed <b>Covid</b> mandates, 3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This tells us the country is more relaxed about Government policy and turned off by naysayers without ideas and solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although I would love to see Act and others engage in real, constructive debate about these issues, as opposed to just saying “no” to attract the negative votes, it seems pretty clear that informed, positive-minded Kiwis won’t be lured out of positivity. Keith Burgess, Sumner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing influence</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sri Lanka led South Asia on multiple socioeconomic indicators for several decades and today owes US$51 billion to foreign agencies including $7 billion to Chinese banks and other lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing’s influence in Sri Lanka has grown exponentially in the past 15 years while Western countries played armchair critics, hosting infrastructure projects that did little to boost the island nation’s economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Sri Lanka’s economic disaster is blamed on factors including mismanagement, <b>pandemic</b> tourism declines and populist tax cuts, Chinese-influenced projects drained public finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves ran out in April and its 22 million people are in dire straits facing food, fuel, and basic medicine shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far Beijing has been quiet in terms of offering assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger and wealthier partners of the Pacific Forum need to significantly increase their presence and offer credible alternatives to the Pacific nations if they are to lessen Beijing’s influence in the region. If not, China will continue to establish partnerships and the poor nations will have no alternative but to depend on them more and more.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not working</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite what Michael Wood writes (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 11), the facts speak for themselves. Hundreds of businesses are unable to find suitable staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government is driven by an ideology that blindly asserts that there are New Zealanders able to fill the vacancies, but clearly this is not correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, there has been a huge increase in those on the Jobseeker benefit. Further proof that locals are not able to solve the shortage of qualified people for so many roles. Nor is the level of wages paid a valid argument, as employers in most industries have increased payments to staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the main cause of the lack of understanding of the demand for overseas workers is the lack of actual business experience in Cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janie Weir, Newmarket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lofty pulpit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech at a recent event for The Freedoms and Rights Coalition, Brian Tamaki once again (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 12) showed how egotistical he is by praising himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He seemingly bragged that he was behind 116 anti-mandate protests, “I organised them, I dated them. Take that.” And his admiring followers cheered. It’s amazing that none of them can see through the charade that he perpetuates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lorraine Kidd, Warkworth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number crunching</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health Minister Andrew Little refuses to agree with many frontline health personnel that there is a crisis. He states that the government has added 5500 medical positions over five-and-a-half years. How many have left in the same period? This government promised to be the most open, transparent and honest <b>New Zealand</b> had seen. Next year, thank goodness, we will all get a chance to reflect on that statement. Paul Jarvis, Orewa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fallen heroes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many thanks to John Clark (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 12) for drawing attention to the perilous plight of trees in Auckland. The devastation continues, notwithstanding recent rulings by the Appeal Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who cares about trees? They only get in the way of making more money. Besides, they’re untidy; they drop leaves and spread roots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble is, if we cut them all down, we’ll have no air to breathe, no places to go for shade, shelter and recreation. No branches for children to climb and play in, no places for the birds to sing, no beauty left for anyone, for anything.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unbelievably generous and vital support - that's how Lifeline Aotearoa is describing the effort by George FM in meeting a shortfall in donations following the cancellation of the Rhythm and Vines festival earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George FM's Tammy Davis, Lifeline Trust and Grants Manager Chloe Skeggs and Lifeline Operations Manager, Helena de Fontenay and General Lee from George FM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last four years, Rhythm and Vines has generously donated a portion of its ticket sales to Lifeline - which amounted to roughly $30,000 per festival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the cancellation of the festival due to the <b>COVID</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>, Lifeline appealed for new donors to help fill the gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The call was answered by the team at George FM, who stepped in to raise funds to meet the shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George FM set up a 28-hour marathon DJ set called George Breakfast's 28 Hour Give Back 2 Back from 6am on June 30 until 10 am on July 1 with a huge selection of DJs playing back to back over that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of George FM's fundraising activity included a text to support code, TradeMe auctions (including a Lifetime pass to Rhythm and Vines) and a Givealittle page. Altogether George FM raised over $56,663, an extraordinary amount given the hard times we are all facing right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lifeline Operations Manager Helena de Fontenay is understandably rapt with the extraordinary support from George FM and its listeners. The fact that people cared to donate what they could means so much, to have people care about Lifeline and the work they do is just priceless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rhythm and Vines consistent support of Lifeline and Kiwi well-being over the years has made a big difference to us and we are incredibly grateful for that support, but the <b>COVID pandemic</b> means these are extraordinary times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lifeline is not Government funded, so the money raised through George Breakfast's 28 Hour Give Back 2 Back is an awesome boost for Lifeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lifeline and Tautoko receive up to 10,000 calls and send and receive around 30,000 texts every month from people in distress, including around 15 to 20 people a day at high risk of suicide. The money raised by George FM will help us support more people and ultimately save lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A huge thank you to George FM for showing that Kiwis care about each other and will do what they can to support each other's <b>mental health</b> and well-being," adds Helena de Fontenay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donations to Lifeline can be made via its website: www.lifeline.org.<b>nz</b>[http://www.lifeline.org.nz]. All donations go towards funding the Lifeline call centres in Auckland and Christchurch.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Safety issues provoke confrontation between staff, DHB execs, writes Alex Spence</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff at a psychiatric facility for acutely unwell teenagers worked in “dangerous” conditions and endured so much stress that it was “severely impacting their physical and <b>mental health</b>”, according to a health and safety notice obtained by the Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about the safety of patients and employees at the Regional Rangatahi Adolescent Inpatient Service (RRAIS), a 12-bed unit at Kenepuru Hospital in Porirua, came to a head late last year, when a “provisional improvement notice” was filed accusing the Capital &amp; Coast District Health Board of breaching its duty of care to employees under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the notice, issued by a health and safety representative in late November, the psychiatric unit was so chronically understaffed that inexperienced workers were put into risky situations they weren’t equipped for — including watching over young people at high risk of suicide or self-harm, “placing both at risk”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most shifts didn’t have enough staff trained to “de-escalate” potentially violent interactions, the notice claimed, while the team leaders couldn’t fully focus on their roles because they so often filled in for others. Nurses constantly worked overtime and double shifts to cover gaps in the roster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is exposing staff to burnout, higher likelihood of a serious incident occurring to staff or client, increased likelihood of medication errors and impacts on overall therapeutic milieu and running of the unit,” the document said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DHB contested the notice, partly because there were “no short-term answers” to address a national workforce crisis in <b>mental health</b>, but had meetings with employees and unions, which led to some improvements in recent months. However, the facility still faces serious staffing challenges — as do <b>mental-health</b> services across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation at RRAIS was first exposed by the Herald last week in an ongoing investigation into the state of <b>mental-health</b> services. It starkly illustrates how public providers across the country are struggling to cope with a rise in people in mental distress at the same time as confronting a severe staffing crunch years in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the Herald reported that two inspections in the past 18 months by the office of the Children’s Commissioner found a multitude of problems at RRAIS relating to staffing, the physical condition of the unit, and the wellbeing of patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first report, based on a surprise inspection in March 2021, the Children’s Commissioner said the facility was “cramped, rundown, and decaying” and so chronically short of experienced employees that staff feared it would lead to “serious injury or death”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years after the Labour Government’s announcement, only one of 13 specialist <b>mental-health</b> inpatient facility upgrades had shovels in the ground, National’s <b>Mental Health</b> &amp; Suicide Prevention spokesman, Matt Doocey, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As part of Budget 2019, the Labour Government announced $350 million of <span class="companylink">Crown</span> funding to go towards upgrading 13 <b>mental-health</b> in-patient facilities. To date, only 2 per cent has been spent and only one facility has shovels in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our most vulnerable Kiwis are left with nowhere to turn as <b>mental-health</b> inpatient facilities are rotting from the inside out, are at consistent over-occupancy, and operating outside of patient safety clinical guidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For years, the <b>mental-health</b> sector and the public have called on the Government to take urgent action and upgrade our specialist services. We are yet to see a plan from the Health Minister on how he will change the course of the trajectory for our worsening facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In June 2021, Andrew Little told media he was ‘extraordinarily frustrated’ that the Government’s $1.9 billion <b>mental-health</b> package wasn’t going towards services and that less than 1 per cent had been spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A year on and the minister has failed to deliver any better outcomes for Kiwis because he has been too focused on his ideological-driven health restructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Labour promised to transform the <b>mental-health</b> system but sadly, for many Kiwis, <b>mental-health</b> services are more out of reach now than when Labour first came into office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Their lack of urgency to commence construction on these specialist facilities has now left Kiwis who require these acute levels of care at odds of where to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What our vulnerable Kiwis need is a well-managed plan to execute change. Unfortunately, we lack a Government and a minister who prioritises <b>mental health</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald has also obtained numerous documents from the DHB and other sources which have not been made public before now and provide new insights into the extent of the problems at the unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They reveal that the safety issues provoked a confrontation between staff and DHB executives late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, 27 nurses and support staff wrote to union representatives at the <b>New Zealand</b> Nurses Organisation and Public Service Association, warning of the risks of understaffing and unsafe physical environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We as a team are trying our best to provide quality care for our youth,” they wrote. “We are committed to each other and this is one of the only positives we currently have. This team is stretched and we need support from senior management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The DHB has a duty of care to their staff to provide a safe working environment and for the reasons outlined above they are not meeting this. This makes our work of caring for vulnerable youth so much more challenging.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That month, the DHB produced an assessment classifying the problems at RRAIS as a high and unacceptable risk, citing ongoing vacancies and an unsuitable environment as constraining the service’s capacity to provide safe care for patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deteriorating working conditions could, it said, lead to increased stress for employees, union action, breaches of health and safety legislation, “unplanned service restrictions with no therapeutic interventions for clients”, failure to meet performance targets, and “adverse publicity and reputational damage”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, senior managers from the DHB’s <b>mental-health</b> service met union representatives to discuss the safety issues. But a month later RRAIS’ acting team leader wrote to those executives saying there’d been “little change in our situation” and staff representatives would be issuing a provisional improvement notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That notice — which one union representative told the Herald was a “last resort” — said the staff had achieved “little traction” in their talks with management. “No changes have occurred and there has been no appreciable improvement to the health and safety of staff and patients,” the notice said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These dangerous working conditions have still not been resolved. Staff are working under increased pressure and stress, severely impacting their physical and <b>mental health</b> due to excessive demands. This has been documented and raised through daily reportable events with insufficient additional support to mitigate the risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, DHB managers held a meeting with about 30 RRAIS staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feeling among employees, according to the DHB’s formal record of the meeting, was that management’s response to their concerns had been “disappointing and failed to acknowledge the distress the team were under”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While management had pledged to make improvements, employees were frustrated that these were not happening quickly enough. Staff spoke of “feeling at risk” because of the shortage of experienced nurses, and worried that this would continue while the DHB took time to recruit replacements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is concern that the physical and <b>mental wellbeing</b> of staff and rangatahi is not being heard, staff are losing confidence, in that issues will not be resolved,” the meeting notes state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Karla Bergquist, executive director of Capital &amp; Coast DHB’s <b>mental-health</b> service, wrote to RRAIS staff representatives acknowledging their concerns and assuring them that “we have taken these concerns very seriously”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintenance work was already under way to improve the state of the unit, Bergquist said, and a wider refurbishment was planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>mental-health</b> service was doing all it could to fill staff vacancies and had submitted a business to increase the budget for full-time employees at the unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, an action and improvement plan created by the DHB recorded progress on several fronts. Some renovations to the facility had been carried out, although this had been disrupted by <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>. Handheld safety alarms had been installed. Staff were being trained in de-escalation techniques and there had been a reduction in the number of patients secluded or physically restrained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, staffing pressures remained because of a critical national shortage of nurses and other experienced <b>mental-health</b> professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Bergquist said the staffing challenges at RRAIS were being felt across the <b>mental-health</b> system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Inpatient volumes have also increased and acuity is higher, meaning there are more rangatahi with complex needs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid these pressures, she said, the health authority (Capital &amp; Coast was now part of the combined Te Whatu Ora/<span class="companylink">Health <b>New Zealand</b></span>, after a national restructuring took effect this month), was committed to “continuously improve the quality of service we provide” and took the safety of staff and patients seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority had implemented numerous short-term and long-term measures in recent months to improve RRAIS, Bergquist said, including more therapeutic activities for patients, allocating new nursing graduates to the facility, and stepping up its recruitment campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The RRAIS leadership team continues to work with staff to find solutions that ensure safe staffing,” Bergquist said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other agencies who are responsible for these type of situations but the police become the “ambulance at the bottom of the cliff” because there is a lack or reluctance of welfare agencies to respond and the overworked and stretched blue line become the next port of call.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vision for NZWhat a great letter “Fast track to the Third World” from Johan Stabbert of Warkworth (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 7.) <b>New Zealand</b> Inc needs to take stock, the Government needs to tune in and listen to the mood and cries of desperation of the nation if we are not to continue to go down the “rabbit hole” of chaotic and illogical decision making, disillusionment, and with it the wastage of millions and millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the day, it all comes down to “common sense” and good forward planning, not “pie in the sky” as seems the “will and want” of the current politicians in power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> must focus and make better decisions on health (read nurses, doctors, hospitals), wellbeing (<b>mental health</b> and homeless people), education (particularly early education), policing, and necessary and practical infrastructure to name just a few critical areas needing urgent attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pay better wages to teachers, nurses, firefighters. Fully fund <span class="companylink">St John Ambulance</span> and <span class="companylink">Westpac</span> rescue helicopters, hire more police. Welfare recipients of working age should not receive funding unconditionally, there are plenty of jobs around, therefore welfare should not be given unqualified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigration is also a key component — nurses must be fast-tracked and be eligible for immediate residence as are doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s get this great country back on track, and I am sure the economy will get all the necessary stimulus needed to make <b>New Zealand</b> one of the most attractive and successful countries once again but it will take time and considerable effort make no mistake — let’s get it sorted!</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are good politicians and good Prime Ministers. Good politicians make decisions based on what will keep them popular versus the good Prime Minister who will make them on what they believe is good for the country. Unfortunately, good Prime Ministers can end up unpopular with their party and the public for obvious reasons.</p>

</div><div class="author">ACT <b>New Zealand</b> </div><div>806 words</div><div>11 July 2022</div><div>06:21</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Kiwis deserve better than another $80 billion debt from an experimental response the next time a <b>pandemic</b> arises. ACT would commission an independent investigation with local and foreign investigators into the Government's <b>COVID</b> response and its effects on <b>mental health</b>, learning, crime, social cohesion and the economy," says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have called for a Royal Commission into the Government's <b>COVID</b> response, but Jacinda Ardern is pathologically unable to admit fault. As we saw in the Charlotte Bellis saga, you need to take the Government to court to get an apology for malice and incompetence, and even then it's not certain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The current Labour Government doesn't want to be held accountable for its actions, or even know whether it could have done things better. It has treated Kiwis with disdain, and they deserve better from the next government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Under Labour, the only illumination we get is from gaslighting. It pretends against all rational evidence that actions aren't the reason our health system is crumbling, our businesses are closing, and our <b>COVID</b> cases are still rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impacts of our response have been immense. We have reason to believe there will be significant impacts on our children's educations, <b>mental health</b>, benefit dependency, crime, social cohesion, business strength and infrastructure for years and years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"ACT's investigation will drill down into exactly what impacts have been had, so we can then go about addressing them and producing a plan that will protect New Zealanders across all aspects of a <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This investigation will not be an inhouse affair carried out by a small coterie of anointed experts. <b>New Zealand</b> is too small for an objective investigation. ACT's investigation would lean on experts from a range of countries that did things well, and not so well, to give an honest review. We would ask Taiwanese, Swedish, and Australian experts, for example, to be part of the investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its terms of reference will include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects of the Government's response on <b>mental health</b>, children's learning, and crime</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects of the Government's response on social cohesion and trust in institutions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiscal and economic costs of the Government's response, including the use of unconventional monetary policy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of Quality Adjusted Life Years saved from <b>COVID</b> in comparison with other challenges</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compliance with the Bill of Rights, and whether restrictions were always justifiable in a free and democratic society</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absorption of technologies such as for testing and tracing, into the response</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relationships with private sector partners including technology suppliers, GPs, and community vaccination centres</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quality of advice and the Government's attention to advice from a range of departments other than Health, such as the Ministry of Education and Treasury</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing of vaccine ordering and distribution</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Investigation would be expected to complete within one year, and become an asset that could save <b>New Zealand</b> tens of billions of dollars in the future. It would also go some way to restoring <b>New Zealand</b>'s international reputation from being a backwards hermit kingdom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The investigation is not simply about learning what Labour did wrong. It is about working out what we need to do right. There will be another <b>pandemic</b>. Probably not this year, hopefully not in the next decade, but almost certainly in our lifetime. In the future, it could save <b>New Zealand</b> billions of dollars in costly mistakes. We literally cannot afford to repeat Labour's handling of this <b>Pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having a publicly available <b>pandemic</b> plan based on this research will take the fear and uncertainty away from society. In the event of another <b>pandemic</b> people will have certainty of our government's approach, they won't be expected to tune into to Government broadcast at midday every day to figure out the fate of their business or what new restrictions will be placed on their rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Granted, there will also be variables in the event of a <b>pandemic</b>, but by being upfront with New Zealanders and planning ahead and learning from our past mistakes we can proceed with confidence that our response will protect New Zealanders in a way that doesn't sacrifice their education, <b>mental health</b>, finances, and many other aspects of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Simply put, the next Government will become the experts in managing a <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't afford to have a lost generation who suffers due to the impacts of our <b>COVID</b> response, without even looking at what we could have done better and ensuring we don't make the same mistakes again. While other parties are focused on the next election, ACT is focused on the next generation."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a <b>pandemic</b>, climate change, entrenched inequality, and a darkening picture internationally, it’s pretty easy to feel cynical about our ability to make the world better at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems like the job of our political leaders these days is just to rush from crisis to crisis trying to fight fires. As the PM bluntly put it this week, “The world is bloody messy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has been the trend for a while, but I’d argue it’s getting worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as we’re seeing in Sydney at the moment, climate change means we’re going to be living in a world where natural disasters are much more common — from floods to droughts to fires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job for any government is increasingly going to be one of disaster management and response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s tempting to be pessimistic about this, to get so overwhelmed by the big disasters in the world, to switch off the news and check out, that you forget all the good that governments can do to make a difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that would be a big mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because for all that the modern world is beset by big problems, our collective choices still matter. Government can still be an instrument of really positive change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few examples recently that come to mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at what’s happened with the new food in school’s policy. More than 220,000 children are getting a guaranteed healthy meal each day; more than 45 million meals provided to hungry kids so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And principals and teachers are raving about what a difference it’s made for students’ ability to learn and focus in the classroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One principal was reported this week saying it was “a real game-changer” for their kids, while another said, “In all the years of educational initiatives, this is the one that has made the single biggest difference.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or here’s one of my favourite ones: remember the dreaded “Ute Tax”? If you’d listened to the cynics and talk-back hosts, it was going to be the end of the Kiwi ute. Tradies were going to be forced to catch the bus with their tools on their backs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all turned out to be nonsense, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huge numbers of people are still buying utes, it’s just that the extra money raised went to give a discount for cleaner cars and it’s worked extraordinarily well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, before the discount came in, hybrids and EVs were just 8 per cent of new car purchases in <b>New Zealand</b>. Now that number is 20 per cent. That’s more than double in less than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means thousands more people saving money on petrol and reducing their carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or how about <b>mental health</b>? It doesn’t get talked about nearly enough but after the big investment in <b>mental health</b> in 2019, more than 330,000 people have been given <b>mental health</b> support at their GP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people in those situations, that intervention can stop minor <b>mental health</b> issues spiralling into something major — it can literally be a lifesaver for some of those 330,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, look at the huge difference made by the wage subsidy. It’s likely that hundreds of thousands of Kiwis would have lost their jobs during the lockdowns without it, tens of thousands of businesses would certainly have gone under.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine if we’d had our current <b>Covid</b> inflation spike while big numbers of Kiwis were out of work? Instead, we’ve got the lowest unemployment on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’d argue that all of this should be an antidote to cynicism and hopelessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the world is a darker and scarier place than it was 20 years ago. But if you are one of the hundreds of thousands of kids who are learning better because their stomach is full, or one of hundreds of thousands of people who received <b>mental health</b> support exactly when they needed it, those changes can make all the difference to you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apathy or hopelessness doesn’t actually fix any problems. Pessimism doesn’t make anyone better off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if we look around, we see that with concerted effort, things do get better. Good ideas still make a big difference.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rangatahi at a <b>mental health</b> facility in Wellington are regularly going to the toilet in cardboard potties or "cowboy hats" in seclusion, according to a new report from the Children's Commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A visit to the 12-bed Regional Rangatahi Adolescent Inpatient Service based in Porirua in January found unsafe staffing levels, high rates of seclusion and a unit unfit for purpose, Commissioner Judge Frances Eivers wrote in her report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The service is for young people aged from 12 to 17 who have acute <b>mental health</b> problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The use of seclusion had risen "significantly" since 2020 - there were six seclusion events and 114 restraints in the first half of 2020, compared with 14 seclusions and 124 restraints in the last half of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Staff said this increase is due to unsafe staffing levels, high occupancy and acuity, the physical environment and lack of de-escalation spaces," Eivers' report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our review of seclusion data and clinical notes show that mokopuna are regularly provided cardboard potties (also referred to as 'cowboy hats') while in seclusion, without clear reason or justification."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardboard toilets in seclusion appeared to be routine, and was despite the fact there were bathroom facilities in the seclusion area, Eivers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>mental health</b> service's executive director, Karla Bergquist, accepted cardboard toilets were inadequate, but rejected the point their use was routine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were used when rangatahi were at risk of harming themselves or others, when the use of the bathroom in seclusion was considered a safety risk. The bathroom could be locked from the inside and had no viewing window, "meaning staff cannot remain in contact with rangatahi who may be highly distressed," Bergquist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we acknowledge that this process is far from ideal, it remains the safest option."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area, including the bathroom, was awaiting refurbishment and "part of the refurbishment will be to redevelop the bathroom to uphold the safety and dignity of rangatahi," Bergquist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eivers said the situation at the unit was "highly concerning".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[P]roblems with both the building itself and adequate staff levels are stressful for both the rangatahi and kaimahi."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chronically low staffing levels were a concern, with 6.2 vacancies for nurses at the time of the visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Management are required to work on the floor almost daily due to lack of staffing," Eivers' report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bergquist said the unit was aggressively recruiting in <b>New Zealand</b> and overseas to fill vacancies, but it was still a challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seclusion was used as a last resort and the rise was mainly down to three clients "with very complex <b>mental health</b> needs", she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A project that began in August 2021, which aimed to find alternatives to restraint, had led to a reduction in its use and the service was working towards zero seclusion and restraint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the positive side, Eivers found mokopuna were engaged in activities, had caring and respectful relationships with staff and were involved in every aspect of their care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The staff themselves are clearly key to the young people's wellbeing, going above and beyond to give the rangatahi what they need, treating their role as less of a job than a vocation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eivers was pleased to see changes have been made, and saw the commitment to continue improving things. "My team and I will be following this closely. But they can only do so much."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eivers was hopeful the latest $18.7 million investment for existing specialist child and adolescent <b>mental-health</b> and addiction services, announced in May, would make a difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We all look forward to seeing this money make concrete, tangible change for all rangatahi relying on these services to help them turn their faces to the sun and let the shadows fall behind them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This country's unenviable track record of high child and youth suicide, and the increasing number of children struggling with <b>mental wellbeing</b> in the wake of <b>Covid</b> shows how important it is we get this right, and soon," Eivers said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner of a South Auckland liquor shop is under fire for his decision to allow people to use <span class="companylink">Afterpay</span>, which allows them to drink now, pay later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panmure Bottle O’ recently began offering its customers the option to <span class="companylink">Afterpay</span> their alcohol — paying off their debt in instalments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within hours of the Herald’s reporting on the move, the store said it would no longer accept that form of delayed payment for alcohol, with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Store management said they were “reviewing our policies” and that <span class="companylink">Afterpay</span> would not be used until further notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Nicki Jackson, executive director of Alcohol Healthwatch, earlier said there was “unanimous disbelief” that kind of service could be offered for <b>New Zealand</b>’s “most harmful drug”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Accessibility of alcohol in <b>New Zealand</b> is already high,” she said. “During the <b>pandemic</b> a lot of people are drinking more and there is an exacerbation of <b>mental health</b> issues due to this <b>pandemic</b>, and high levels of alcohol harm. It’s just not in the right direction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year it was only boutique alcohol retailers who were using <span class="companylink">Afterpay</span>, she said, but noted the <b>pandemic</b> could “change that”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now it’s getting into the mainstream and that’s really concerning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was also of concern to Maungakiekie-Tāmaki Local Board chairperson Maria Meredith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From a personal perspective we have major issues in our community around alcohol harm,” she told the Weekend Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“By providing it as <span class="companylink">Afterpay</span> you’re just opening up a can of worms and making people who are already vulnerable more vulnerable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meredith added the store might face pressure from the public to change its practices too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there’s enough people objecting to it, it could force that business to not offer that service.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner of the liquor store initially said the decision had already begun to draw some negative attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you check on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> you’ll see I’ve gotten so many bad comments, I’m a bit worried I’ve spoilt my name.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He told the Weekend Herald he began to offer the service to try to boost his business, which he said had been struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re not doing so good in the business; everything is going up [in price] and so many shops are doing it,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there had been little uptake, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m not getting any customers on the <span class="companylink">Afterpay</span> at the moment.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Braunias finds out how music and a sister’s devotion saved The Singing Cowboy, Jock Hume</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a strange interview. I talked to Jock Hume, 74, in a glasshouse. He dressed in the costume of his legendary character The Singing Cowboy, a country and western music entertainer who has walked the earth these past 50 years as a kind of wandering sheriff of <b>New Zealand</b>, there to maintain good cheer with a song in his heart — he wore cowboy boots and a cowboy hat, a Texan tie, a red check shirt and white trousers. He lives in a village just as elaborate and fantastic. He is a resident at the Claire House Rest Home in Mt Eden, designed as a Victorian fantasy of copper kettles and fine china hanging on the walls of six large white villas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have,” said manager Glenda Kingsbeer, “250 rose bushes.” Head gardener, Alf Simpson, 86, walked past at that precise moment in his gumboots; “251,” he corrected her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glasshouse is used as a visitor’s centre. We met on a winter’s morning. It was freezing in there, a narrow icebox with heavy drops of condensation crawling down the glass, and throughout the interview one of the Claire House garden crew set up a very noisy weed eater and, later, a very noisy leaf blower. We were both dying to escape but Jock’s urge was greater, more profound. He became agitated. He spoke rapidly, and his breathing was fast, laboured, like he was gulping for air in a cave where the oxygen was running scarce. I had gone in with the very best of intentions and Jock was such a kind and lovely man but the interview had plainly become a kind of torture, and finally, I said, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said, “Yes. Yes, yes! Yes.” He meant no to the bottom of his heart, but he laughed or tried to laugh — it sounded more like a cry of pain. “Yes,” he said again. He had a slender body, with a long face and very bright eyes. “But. It’ll be ending soon. It’ll be over soon. It’s making me a little stressed. A few minutes more. You’re seeing Mary tomorrow, she’ll verify everything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He meant his sister Mary, 84, who knows Jock better than anyone alive. His bedroom in the little state rental house in Mt Roskill that he shared with her these past 24 years is empty since he moved into Claire House on April 11 after a stroke in March. “I’ll show you Jock’s room,” she said. The back of the house looked out on to a plum tree, its branches black and bare in the thin light. She walked slowly down the hallway into a room with a single bed and a dressing table. There was an invoice book from his days when The Singing Cowboy was in demand at RSAs, rest homes, and children’s parties. The sums ($75, $350, $500) were written in a tidy hand and with every good standard of efficient book-keeping. That was his best subject at school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He took after his father in that way, and in another respect, too; Neil Hume, bank manager at the <span class="companylink">BNZ</span> in Devonport, when the family lived in Glen Rd, Stanley Bay, and later at Three Lamps in Ponsonby, when the family moved to Hamilton Rd in Herne Bay, was an all-round sportsman, and young Jock was a fast and nimble tennis player, winning the Stanley Bay men’s singles title in two consecutive years. But actually, he was nothing like his father and that was the problem, that was the bane of his existence until something amazing happened — an epiphany, an apotheosis — and out of it was born The Singing Cowboy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The rest is history,” laughed Jock, wringing his hands in the glasshouse. “Hoo boy!”MARY WAS just as gentle as her younger brother, and she spoke in beautiful prose — “deprecating”, “apprehensive”, “calibre”. She had taught primary school at Jean Batten in Māngere, and Ōtāhuhu Primary. It was very cold in her weatherboard state rental, and when I left she wrapped up a fruit loaf in greaseproof paper. When I first arrived, I told her that Jock was like a caged tiger in that glasshouse, and I asked if he was okay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said, “Oh, yes. If something upsets him, he has a good night’s sleep, and the next day, it’s as if it never happened. He lives in the moment. That means he’s at the mercy of whatever. Most of us have an emotional security that carries us through just about everything. He doesn’t seem to have that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked her, “Is he happy?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes,” she said. “He’ll ring up and say, ‘Mary, I’m on a high.’ I’m very grateful that we have a good relationship. I’ve been acquainted with <b>mental illness</b> for a very long time. I joined the Schizophrenia Fellowship in 1987 and I’ve met a lot of people with that illness. So I have learned a lot, and one of the most crucial things, if you have schizophrenia, is that you’re very lucky to have a good relationship with at least someone in the family, and with a doctor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For some people, that doesn’t happen. Their family reject or abandon them, or they’re cold and unsympathetic, and they never find a good doctor, whereas Jock and I were incredibly lucky. We found a marvellous man. When I say found him, he was already my doctor. He was exceptional. Dr Mervyn Gatman. He and his wife, Margaret, were both doctors, in Lake Rd, Takapuna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My father was puzzled as to why Jock couldn’t hold down a job. This was in the 1960s. There were hundreds of jobs, Steve, in the 1960s. Hundreds! It was easy to get a job. But some of the jobs that Jock got, urged on by our dad, he lasted only a morning or a week, and of course, Dad was furious, and so I asked Mervyn would he see Jock. And he did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But of course when Jock came home, he couldn’t tell me anything. I just thought that was a waste of time. I used to see Dr Gatman every three months because I had mild diabetes. And I said, ‘Thank you for seeing my brother,’ and he looked curiously at me and said, ‘He’s schizophrenic, isn’t he?’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And I nearly fell out of the chair with surprise. I had heard the word but I didn’t know much about it. I was so blown away that he would put a name on what was ailing my brother. I said, ‘Doctor, would you treat him? Would you take him on?’ And he did. He saw Jock whenever Jock needed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I said to him after a year, ‘Why don’t you send my brother a bill? You’re not invoicing Jock at all.’ I’ve never forgotten his words. He said, ‘People with <b>mental illness</b> are the unluckiest people in the world, and Margaret and I don’t charge them.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And do you know, Steve, I have told that story to so many people and I can tell you that young people rarely believe me. After Dr Gatman died, Margaret took over Jock, and between them, they treated Jock for a good 20 years, and he never paid a cent. Wasn’t that wonderful? But one of my great sadnesses is that my parents never thanked him. They never rang him up or wrote to him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “Jock told me your dad rode him hard.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes,” she said. “He spent his whole career with the <span class="companylink">BNZ</span>. He was born in 1907 and he was so lucky to have a job in the Depression. He had that focus, that a job was the most important thing, ahead of everything else. The poor man. He had a very bad relationship with his mother. I think it crippled him emotionally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But my grandmother was honest enough and smart enough to identify the problem. My parents got engaged in 1934, and Mum told me that Nan called her into the bedroom when the engagement was announced, and said, ‘You won’t have an easy life with Neil. He’s been the most difficult of my five boys.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She told Mum that she had the most dreadful time giving birth to her first child and that when she discovered she was pregnant with Dad four years later, she was quite sure that this time she would die. So she explained to Mum that she felt she had harmed the baby by her negative feelings. Her fear. She herself was not an affectionate person. I didn’t enjoy holidays with her. I did admire her for warning Mum. But it was too late then.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “Was it a kind of fair warning?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes,” she said. “Mum had a bloody difficult life with Dad. Dad harmed all three of his sons. My sister and me didn’t matter so much, so we didn’t get leaned on, and Jock was the one he leaned on the hardest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Dad used to badger Jock at the dinner table. Jock would put his knife and fork down, and a sick look would come over his face, and he would ask to be excused. And that’s when he started losing weight. He got down to 32 kilograms.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “Wasting away like that — was he trying to disappear, do you think?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t really imagine how it feels,” she said. “He went to hospital, things got so bad. Mum said Dad was furious. He raved on about the benefits of fresh air and exercise! You must know from your work, Steve, what an amazing capacity for denial human beings have. It’s writ large in my family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I could see how miserable Dad was in his old age. He died in 1991. The thing is, Steve, we need personal resources all our lives, but we need them more than ever in our old age, because everything else deserts us, you know. I’m at that stage now. But I’m fine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked, “What about Jock? What are his personal resources?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said, “He leans very heavily on his reputation as The Singing Cowboy. It’s like a treasure. It’s his identity.”EVERY WORD of the origin story of The Singing Cowboy is true, but it has the force and power of a foundation myth. It liberated Jock Hume, released him. It also achieved something I thought of as a motive behind his alarming weight loss as a teenager — it made Jock Hume, made of flesh and blood, disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After he was sent to hospital as a teenager and put in the psych ward, he made a recovery — he talked in our glasshouse interview about how good the food was at Auckland hospital. He went back to school. That was good. But he was forced to look for work. He found plenty of it. The problem was holding on to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hospital orderly. Reading power meters. Delivering groceries,” said Mary, remembering some of his jobs. “One employer rang Mum up and said he’d never met a young man so apprehensive about making a mistake. I’m crying to think of the hell he went through trying to hold down jobs. He just wasn’t equipped for it. When Dad came home for lunch in Herne Bay and found Jock at home, because he’d fled another job, there was hell to pay.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then: epiphany, liberation. He had always liked music. His brother Ian was given a ukulele when they were kids, but it was Jock who wanted it. His parents got him a Suzuki guitar when he was 12. At 13, he entered a talent quest at Takapuna Grammar and sang the cowboy hit Streets of Laredo. He learned more country and western songs and also discovered Auckland’s rich network of country music clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I seen a sign,” he said, and you could tell he was picturing it in his mind, as fresh as when he first saw it. “It was in Newmarket. The Auckland Country Western Club. It looked so good. It stood out so well. So I thought I’d suss it out, I made inquiries and found they met every Monday night. A chap by the name of Rusty Greaves ran it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He meant the great country music entrepreneur and father of 14, a carpenter and yodeller, a man of tremendous decency, generous with his time and support. He made Jock feel at home. “I went every Monday night. Catch the ferry from Devonport, bus up to Newmarket.” He got up and sang, learned yet more country and western songs. But still, the problem of work got at him, made life a struggle, actually a nightmare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until he seized on an idea, or the idea seized him — what are the exact mechanics of an epiphany? It happened on a Sunday afternoon in the summer of 1970. His parents had gone for a drive. He sat on the porch. Beautiful day, the sun sparkling gold on the blue waters of Stanley Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve heard this story many times,” said Mary, but it was a story she never got sick of hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jock said in the rest home glasshouse, “It was nice and peaceful. I sat there for a while thinking about things. I was 22, and I’d had a number of jobs but hadn’t been able to hold them down. And then I thought: ‘I’ll be an entertainer. It’s something I haven’t tried before. I’ll give it a go.’ And, gosh! That was the start. It’s been my lifeline for more than 50 years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary said in her little state house, “And he thought, ‘I’ll pretend to be a cowboy. A singing cowboy.’ And he did. I’ll tell you a story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He used to play at Georgie Pie, 1987 it was. Best job he ever had. Do you know, Steve, for eight hours’ work a week, he was earning more than I was earning all week? He was singing two hours a night from Thursday to Sunday for their family hour. But without telling him — I am an interfering sister I suppose — I made an appointment with the guy who hired Jock. I wanted him to be aware of Jock’s difficulties and background.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was very nice. He said Jock arrived for the audition in his civilian clothes, carrying a bag. This guy told me he thought this wouldn’t come to anything. And Jock said straightaway, ‘Can I go to get changed?’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And he did, and came back as The Singing Cowboy, and the man said he was like a different person. He got the job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked her, “What’s the difference between Jock and The Singing Cowboy?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said, “There isn’t one. He is The Singing Cowboy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked, “But what happens when he isn’t?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He’s nothing,” she said. “He doesn’t exist.”HE HAS achieved one of the most remarkable entertainment careers in <b>New Zealand</b>. The Singing Cowboy is also The Travelling Cowboy: just like his induction into country and western music, when he caught the ferry and the bus to the club in Newmarket, he has always gone from town to town on public transport, sometimes hitch-hiking. Mary said he averaged 16 trips every year. If he wasn’t playing at a venue, he was busking. It earned him a rare accolade: he was an urban legend who was also a rural legend, always on the move, forever on the road in both islands, singing Folsom Prison Blues and Ring of Fire and Coward of the County and, of course, The Streets of Laredo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I called three of his peers and they spoke of him with deep respect. “Everybody in <b>New Zealand</b> country music would know who he was, without a doubt,” said Tom Haines, 88, who was involved in the Maraetai country music club, and had known Jock since 1985. “He was known all over the place. You’d see him everywhere and he was well-liked wherever he went, very well-liked. He was like a <b>New Zealand</b> character of yesteryear.” Tom’s wife, Joanie, 87, called out, and it was almost like she was defining a <b>New Zealand</b> character of yesterday: “Jock’s a beautiful man who would help anyone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He’s travelled <b>New Zealand</b>, hasn’t he,” said Pam Austin, 82, who ran the country music club at Bucklands Beach. “I would say he’s been everywhere. We’d go on holidays and lo and behold, there’s Jock, busking or playing at a carnival. You’d see him everywhere! And kids just loved him. He was a cowboy. He wore all the gear. He’d sit down with them and they’d fuss over him. He was such good value.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Singing Cowboy continues to perform, busking in a spot just around the corner from the rest home, on Dominion Rd. His stroke has weakened the volume of his voice and affected his strum, but busking is a practical and deeply enjoyable method of rehab. “We certainly let him go out there,” said Claire House manager Glenda Kingsbeer. “But he’s very determined. He said to me, ‘I want to go to Hamilton and play there.’ I had to tell him no, we have to be sufficiently protective. No public transport. Stay close.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said to her, “But the reason I thought to interview him and write this story is that I saw him busking last weekend at the shops in Te Atatū Peninsula.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenda’s mouth fell open, and she blinked. She said, “What?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “Yeah. Te Atatū.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She laughed and laughed. “Oh God,” she said. “But that’s Jock.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His sister Mary said, “He trusts everyone, and expects to roam the country. He hated <b>lockdown</b>. He said once it was over, he’d be going on a cheer up <b>New Zealand</b> tour. That’s his mission in life, to cheer up <b>New Zealand</b>. He believes in himself. When he plays for kids, he doesn’t pretend to come down to their level; he is at that level. He’s one of them, and they sense that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “He’s an innocent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes,” she said. “That’s a lovely word.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Country music veteran Estelle Crooks first saw Jock play in 1974. “He always had a very unique guitar strum,” she said. Tom Haines had put it another way: “He was his own keeper.” They meant that a striking feature of his music was his timing. To listen to The Singing Cowboy was to listen to a man who seemed to play songs wildly out of time and yet did it with total conviction. It was haphazard, not at all correct, but it makes you lean in closer, partly because his music makes you feel in the presence of something unique, partly also to try and figure out where his strum is going and if it will catch up with his singing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He had a lot of kudos with country music clubs,” Estelle Crooks said. “He was independent, self-sufficient. Always on the bus! He was an unusual person. He probably had lots of problems but he always put on a jovial front. He was just such a nice, kind person.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Hume had placed a photo of Jock on her dining room table. It showed him being presented with the Variety Club Unsung Hero Award in 2005. “Read the words, Steve,” she instructed. My interview with Mary was sometimes like being in her classroom. I did as I was told, and read out loud from the award citation, “In recognition of his remarkable zest for life and acknowledging the delight his entertainment has given so many in <b>NZ</b> over so many years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She gazed at her brother’s happy face in the frame, and said, “We had a wonderful night at the top table. We were treated like VIPs. Beautiful dinner, and Jock’s smile when he got the award — you will never see him looking happier than that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was typical of Mary. She always made everything about her brother. She held him up as a star. Her devotion to him was beautiful to behold. The little state house that backed on to a park, the two little bedrooms on either side of a narrow wallpapered corridor — the ballad of The Singing Cowboy is one of <b>New Zealand</b>’s most touching love stories.MARY RAN into her younger brother in downtown Auckland at Christmas 1973. She talked about this like another origin story; it marked the start of something. The details were fresh, profound. She said, “Mum and Dad retired in Kerikeri, and they set poor Jock up in a little flat on Albert Rd, Devonport, and expected him to live on his own, which was monumentally wrong. And just seeing him at the bottom of Queen St — he looked shocking. He looked pale. Thin. He looked so sick. My heart snowed me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What an unusual phrase; she said it again, with real feeling. “My heart snowed me. And so when he rang in February ’74 and said, ‘Mary, I’m not happy, can I come and stay with you?’, I said, ‘Yes, of course.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s funny he said stay and not live. So he came to stay, and never left.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They lived together in her council flat in Greys Ave, near the central police station, for 22 years, and then 24 years together in Mt Roskill. All that time she looked after him, took care of him, allowed him to live his amazing fantasy life as The Singing Cowboy. She meant the world to Jock. He told the story about moving in with her, and said, “It was perfect from then on. Perfect. Mary would cook me a nice breakfast, and go to work. She’d get up first. I’d get up and have a cup of tea and biscuits to keep me going, and then have my wash and shave, and eat my breakfast ... I said to her when I moved in, ‘I like it here, Mary. I would like to stay here till the end of my days.’ And I just about have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “She’s really looked after you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes,” he said. “I’m terribly grateful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “She’s very proud of you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes,” he said, “considering what I’ve achieved despite all the difficulties.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she really was; in fact, she spoke about Jock not merely with pride, but awe, too. He meant the world to her, too. “He’s taught me a lot. He sees the world so differently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said to her, “Jock’s story could have been tragic. It’s sad, definitely. But really it’s a story of triumph.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes,” she said. “I like that word. I do like that word. Very good, Steve. When people are so different, and unique, and Dr Gatman’s word, unlucky, that’s an opportunity for other people to respond well. And many people have with Jock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But Mum was embarrassed or ashamed about Jock’s <b>mental health</b>. I remember one day, there was a job that needed doing around the house, and she said, ‘Jock should be able to do that. After all, he is a man.’ I didn’t know how to cope with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The next time I saw her, I said, ‘What you said about Jock was wrong. Jock’s a child in an ageing body.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mum didn’t answer. She just looked away. It’s quite interesting, isn’t it? She took it in but she didn’t like it and she didn’t like me saying it. She never referred to it again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked, “How do you think Jock sees the world?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ll give you a little example,” she said. “He’s often shocked, stroke, amused me. We were watching the news one night and there was a story about the Steven Wallace killing in Waitara, when he was shot by the police [in 2000]. And do you know what Jock’s comment was? ‘Waitara has never been good to me.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not Steven Wallace losing his life, not the impact on the public or the police, but when he’s gone there to busk, they didn’t appreciate him. Don’t you think that’s funny?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “He might have been making a comment. Maybe he was saying, ‘That’s a bad place.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes,” she said. “Yes, to some extent. ‘They never treated me well.’ Perhaps.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I said, “He was maybe getting to a truth about Waitara. ‘There’s something wrong with that town.’ And he felt it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary said, “I don’t really know how Jock’s mind works. It’s so different to ours ...”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was very graciously saying I had no idea what I was talking about. The range and dimensions of Jock’s mind were a mystery, something to marvel at, but she was on certain ground when it came to his heart. You could walk a long day’s march before you found a husband, a wife, a lover, a parent, a child, or a long, close friend who spoke of someone with as much love in her voice as Mary Hume, the shining star in the ballad of The Singing Cowboy. We sat in the living room of her Mt Roskill house on a cold winter’s day. She kept a magnifying glass close to the phone, there were photos of cats on the walls. She said of Jock Hume, legend, entertainer, brother, “He’s a really good person. I really admire and respect him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the thing about The Singing Cowboy: maybe all his songs, all his stories, were his song, his story. I asked him, “What do you love about country music?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great troubadours of the <b>New Zealand</b> road said, “It tells a story based on true things that have happened over the years.”</p>

</div><div class="author">John Weekes </div><div>755 words</div><div>9 July 2022</div><div>The New Zealand Herald</div><div>NZHLD</div><div>C004</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022 NZME Publishing Ltd. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labour crisis will probably last all year, an economist says, and more migrants, fewer <b>Covid</b> cases and even robots will have a role in resolving worker shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low unemployment, high rates of illness and net migration loss have impacted retail, food processing, hospitality and tourism businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NZIER principal economist Christina Leung said no significant net migration gains were expected until 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said a tight labour market in <b>Australia</b> was adding inflationary and even more labour supply pressures this side of the Tasman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existence of a labour shortage was not in much dispute but there was some debate about the causes, and solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two separate factors were driving labour shortages, Leung said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Pandemic</b> border restrictions had stifled the supply of foreign workers. And Leung said thousands of new daily Omicron cases forced people not to work, or to isolate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of workers in professional services can work from home,” Leung added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many in hospitality could not. And the <b>pandemic</b>’s persistence was causing partial closures and service cuts at many hospitality providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The incentive to invest in labour-saving technology becomes greater,” she said. “It does encourage firms to think of new and innovative ways to carry out their business.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leung said customers might see more robots in restaurants, although culinary cyborgs would not likely be mainstream any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald last month found eateries in Northland, Rotorua and Auckland had introduced robot service to meet labour shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labour crisis was afflicting many countries, including <b>Australia</b>, and Leung said that complicated challenges for <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Firms will have to think about how they can better attract and retain talent. Wages are only a part of the equation,” she added. “Some people come to <b>New Zealand</b> because of the lifestyle and the experience.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leung said the labour shortage would not likely be resolved by encouraging workers to take on second jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some could have side gigs, most could not or would not — at least not to a degree to meaningfully impact the labour crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given that the labour market is so tight, we would expect the utilisation is already up to capacity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first year of the <b>pandemic</b>, net migration plummeted from 91,900 to 6600. And in the year ended February 2022, the country had a net migration loss of 7600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said fiscal policy early in the <b>pandemic</b> ended up overstimulating the economy, and pushing house prices up dramatically. “That made everyone feel wealthy, and happy to borrow, and happy to spend.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to travel abroad, many people splashed out on consumer goods and material objects, rather than services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Globally, manufacturing experienced a massive surge in demand. The bigger supply disruption, in terms of long-lasting impacts, has been the closed border,” Zollner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduced labour supply pushed wages up, and now a lack of workers, including skilled staff, was impacting many sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look at measures like the number of job ads divided by the number of unemployed people, it’s off the charts.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zollner said <b>New Zealand</b> for a long time relied on migration to “paper over the cracks” in areas including education and <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some of these areas were struggling greatly, as was hospitality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some industry groups and the National Party have been urging the Government to speed up visa processing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But the Government is wary of opening the floodgates just as the economy slows,” Zollner added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said many factors made the next few months unusually tricky to forecast, and it was still to be seen how the Reserve Bank might intervene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight Australian labour market was already luring Kiwis, Zollner said. That could compel <b>New Zealand</b> employers keen to retain staff to pay more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But low population growth could also drive an increase in property vacancies, pushing rents down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflationary pressures and the constricted labour market were expected to influence a possible official cash rate adjustment at next week’s Reserve Bank meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rate hike would impact mortgages and savings rates for many, and likely reduce spending and cool the economy but hopefully not spark a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zollner said there was some debate on whether unemployment rates could fall even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Talking to businesses, you don’t get the impression it can drop too much further. How long can it go? We see monetary policy getting traction on demand, maybe this quarter.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A successful partnership between Mayors Taskforce for Jobs (MTFJ) and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) Industry Partnerships has paved the way for a young man to become a joiner, and work towards owning the business one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell Boyce, an 18-year-old school leaver from Tararua College, gained an apprenticeship at Murray Judd Joinery in Woodville, with the support of MTFJ and MSD's Community Recovery Programme. The programme also provided him with tools and helped him gain his restricted driver licence. The programme has been running for two years and has placed over 2,500 youth and <b>Covid</b>-displaced people into employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the success of this programme, MTFJ and MSD are pleased to announce a new $14-million investment for the next financial year. The Rural Community Resilience programme will focus on placing NEETS (young people not in education, employment, or training), people living with disabilities and other disadvantaged people into work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MTFJ chair and Ōtorohanga Mayor Max Baxter says the partnership has been immensely successful in helping young people into employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mitchell is just one example of many youth we've helped. I've heard that his employer describes him as an asset to the business and this is music to my ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we are doing is not only helping youth into work, we're helping our businesses thrive in our rural communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hon. Carmel Sepuloni, Minister Social Development and Employment says: "Many young people have missed out on basic life skills due to the disruption caused by <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> and many are impacted by anxiety and other <b>mental health</b> challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This means that local supports for young people and employers are critical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are pleased to be able to continue to fund this mahi and continue to collaborate with councils around <b>New Zealand</b> to focus on supporting rangatahi and businesses in rural areas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell's employer, Murray Judd says Mitchell wouldn't have been able to do the apprenticeship without the support of the programme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray likes to give young people a chance and is glad he was able to provide that opportunity. "Mitchell is one in a million, he's really stepped up to the mark and is doing a good job."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell now makes kitchen cabinetry and bench tops from scratch and takes a lot of pride in his work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first kitchen he built and installed is likely to be highlighted in a house and garden magazine as part of the client's renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His work is more than just a job and Murray now feels like family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like we're father and son not employer/employee," Mitchell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We talk about investments, how to get a mortgage and I even housesit for them when they're away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell says he is incredibly appreciative of the extra support and guidance Murray gives him. "It's a great opportunity and building towards my future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's got big plans and Murray has even talked to Mitchell about taking over the business when he retires.</p>

</div><div class="author">Bess Manson </div><div>635 words</div><div>8 July 2022</div><div>Dominion Post</div><div>DOMPOS</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2022 Fairfax New Zealand Limited. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He donated $50 million for Wellington's new children's hospital, now Mark Dunajtschik is giving a further $40-50m to build a <b>mental health</b> unit in Lower Hutt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money, donated by Dunajtschik and his business and life partner, Dorothy Spotswood, will finance a new 34-bed adult <b>mental health</b> facility on the Hutt Hospital campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mark Dunajtschik <b>Mental Health</b> Centre will replace the 24-bed Te Whare Ahuru - an existing facility on the hospital campus - adding an extra 10 beds for <b>mental health</b> patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of the 3500-square- metre unit, designed by CCM Architects, will begin next June. It is expected to open by mid-2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 86-year-old philanthropist and property developer made the announcement after receiving the Tribute to a Wellington Icon Award at the Gold Awards at Wellington's TSB Arena last night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking before the event, Dunajtschik said he wanted to use his wealth for the benefit of the community. "It is a matter of judgment [about] where the biggest need is. I read the newspaper religiously every night. There is a general awareness that <b>mental health</b> is an issue and anyone who hasn't noticed that can't be living with their eyes open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have been lucky and fortunate to be making good money in life, and I want to spend it in the community where I made it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dunajtschik is usually a hands- on developer. He and Spotswood are a team of two who work every day getting involved in the minutiae of every aspect of a build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the <b>mental health</b> unit, though, they will be involved only financially. He said the $40-$50m was a "ballpark price", which had to be confirmed on the finalised design and then with construction company McKee Fehl. The concept for the unit had been gestating for about a year, he said. An agreement was signed with the Ministry of Health about six weeks ago for the project to go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government had set aside $30m to replace Te Whare Ahuru with a modern facility of the same size but Dunajtschik's contribution meant that sum could be redistributed to other <b>mental health</b> projects around the country, Health Minister Andrew Little said. "This latest contribution will benefit not only the Wellington region but will also have knock-on benefits for the rest of the country because the balance of the government funding that was intended for the Hutt Valley unit can go into other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can all be incredibly grateful for the extraordinary philanthropy of Mr Dunajtschik, who made <b>New Zealand</b> his home many years ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little, who was unable to attend the Gold Awards because he has <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, said he had thanked Dunajtschik earlier for this donation and for the $50 million he has already donated towards the new children's hospital for Wellington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the Children's Hospital Te Wao Nui, Dunajtschik and Spotswood have flown under the radar with much of their philanthropy over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multi-millionaires started the helicopter rescue service Life Flight Trust in 1975, funding it for a decade before a commercial sponsor came on board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wellington Free Ambulance and the Graeme Dingle Foundation have been beneficiaries of their philanthropy, among many other charities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the Gold Awards event last night , Dunajtschik, who was born in former Yugoslavia, dug out his response from the Immigration Department dated February 1957 to his application for a visa to come to <b>New Zealand</b>. The reply was a three-line letter. "It said: 'The Department has considered favourably your request to immigrate to <b>New Zealand</b>.' For the last 64 years I have strived to show my appreciation for the favourable consideration from the department."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winners of the <b>New Zealand</b> Young Farmers Norwood National Awards have been announced for the 2021 year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Held at the Semenoff Stadium in Whangarei on Thursday night (7 July), the event was hosted by Jay Reeve and Duncan Heyde from "Rock Drive with Jay and Dunc'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Club of the Year was awarded to Morinsville-Ngarua Young Farmers for multiple reasons, including their achievement of raising more than $10,000 for <b>mental health</b> charity Will to Live through a naked calendar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tasman's Roshean Woods was awarded Service to Young Farmers and Aorangi's James Hurst took out an award for leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pendarves After Harvest Party (Aorangi) took out the best event, Fitzherbert Young Farmers (Taranaki Manawatu) won the health and safety award for its workshops with Kane Briscoe, and Inglewood Young Farmers rose to the top in membership growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the coveted award for Best Region went to Otago Southland for its strategic direction and support provided to members, clubs and executive teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Norwood Awards kicked off with the Tavendale and Partners debate going down between Auckland City and Lincoln Young Farmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auckland City took out the debate, arguing for the moot that electric vehicles are the future of farming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winners of the NZYF Tournament Series were also announced after fiercely competing for the coveted titles earlier in the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outgoing <b>New Zealand</b> Young Farmers Board Chair Kent Weir said it was a great night to celebrate the hard work of all their members after another tough year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Norwood NZYF Awards are a great celebration of everyone and their successes and achievements both as individuals and collectively," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<b>Covid</b> restrictions have disrupted multiple clubs and events so it was great to celebrate all our fantastic members, their achievements, and the fact our Young Farmers Clubs have been successful through a difficult two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members are the heart of this organisation, their volunteer work, time and passion keep our grassroots Clubs alive and thriving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morrinsville-Ngarua Young Farmers' passion and commitment is a standout example of how Clubs contribute to their community and the wellbeing of young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roshean Woods' contribution, time and energy she consistently puts into the organisation has been immense. As a young person not from a farming background, she demonstrates an amazing passion for people, Young Farmers and the food and fibre sector as a whole. It is people like Roshean who drive the success of the organisation and its members, and help to achieve goals at a personal, Club, regional and national level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was great to see James Hurst pick up a leadership award as well, his leadership of the Aorangi region through challenging times was exceptional and he really stepped up to the plate when it was needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congratulations to Otago Southland, a passionate region of young farmers that always delivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly a final congratulations to all our award winners and nominees whose selfless contributions don't go unnoticed and are greatly appreciated by everyone involved in Young Farmers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>NZ</b> Health tech startup, oVRcome has won a Trans-Tasman Innovation &amp; Growth Fund Award at a ceremony in Sydney this evening. Christchurch-based founder, Adam Hutchinson attended the celebratory dinner, alongside Australasia's top business leaders and ministerial representatives, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who spoke at the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Awards showcase some of the best examples of innovation, collaboration and growth. The prize includes a cash prize of AU $25,000 and the invite only opportunity to attend and present at the 2022 <b>Australia New Zealand</b> Leadership Forum (ANZLF).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">oVRcome helps people overcome anxiety disorders and social anxiety through VR exposure therapy. Programmes are delivered through the oVRcome virtual reality Smartphone app, paired with a VR headset. Participants are immersed in virtual environments so as to relax and distract. Anxiety and phobias include heights, spiders, flying, and dogs. oVRcome has been credited with supporting many to face their fear of needles and have their <b>Covid</b> vaccination, others have credited with helping them face their fear of flying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our goal is to reduce the treatment gap by making treatment for anxiety disorders more accessible" founder Adam Hutchinson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam was inspired to develop oVRcome after becoming alarmed by <b>mental health</b> statistics. Recognising that accessibility was a key issue, he began working with a team of clinical psychologists to develop an accessible smart-phone based tool to help. It is estimated that up to 80% of anxiety sufferers do not seek treatment currently. Barriers include cost, location of the patient, the stigma of going to a psychologist and the lack of trained psychologists. oVRcome has undergone clinical trial through Otago University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are excited that our work has been recognised with this award, and to be able to present to and network with other innovators from both sides of the Tasman," Adam says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horrific conditions exposed at ‘chaotic’ teen <b>mental health</b> unit, writes Alex Spence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astaffing crisis at a psychiatric facility for teenagers with severe <b>mental illness</b> became so dire employees worried it would lead to “serious injury or death”, according to damning inspection reports obtained by the Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspectors from the Children’s Commissioner’s office visited the Regional Rangatahi Adolescent Inpatient Service (RRAIS), a 12-bed facility in Porirua, twice in the past 18 months and found a multitude of alarming problems relating to staffing, the physical state of the unit, and the wellbeing of patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their reports, which have not been made public until now, detailed numerous examples of poor design and maintenance — including broken windows, no curtains in the girls’ bedrooms, “tired and depressing” decor, numerous ligature points, and broken locks — that made the building unsuitable for highly vulnerable patients experiencing conditions such as psychosis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspectors also expressed alarm distressed teenagers were held for up to two-and-a-half days in a cold, barren seclusion area where some were given cardboard potties nicknamed “cowboy hats” to go to the toilet in, and the only outdoor space was a “small cage covered with mesh” visible from a public street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Safety issues at the “rundown, decaying” facility were compounded by a critical shortage of skilled employees to care for the young patients, the inspectors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Staff were concerned about the safety of mokopuna at the unit and were afraid of serious injury or death,” they said in one of the reports. “They described the unit as ‘chaotic’ or ‘in crisis’ as a result of unsafe staffing levels and a chronic shortage of experienced staff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRAIS, part of the Kenepuru Hospital complex, is one of three specialist inpatient psychiatric units for young people, serving patients from Gisborne to Wellington. It was operated by the Capital &amp; Coast District Health Board until a major restructuring this month merged all DHBs into a national operating body known as Health <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Frances Eivers, the Children’s Commissioner, told the Herald the state of the rangatahi unit was “highly concerning”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My team and I will be following this closely,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karla Bergquist, Health <b>NZ</b>’s executive director of <b>mental health</b> services in the Capital, Coast and Hutt Valley region, said the authority accepted the recommendations and had taken steps since the inspectors’ last visit in January to address them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRAIS was trying to hire new staff to fill vacancies, Bergquist said, although “recruitment remains a challenge both nationally and locally”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We acknowledge that the facility is outdated and does not offer an optimal therapeutic environment,” Bergquist said. Some maintenance work has been carried out since the last inspection but was delayed by the <b>coronavirus pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald obtained the inspection reports as part of an investigation into the state of <b>mental health</b> services. Interviews with dozens of service users, data from multiple public bodies, and thousands of pages of government and health authority documents have exposed how DHBs across the country were struggling to cope with a rising tide of mental distress amplified by the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depleted by years of underfunding and poor planning, public <b>mental health</b> providers are now desperately short of the psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and other skilled staff required to meet the rising need, the investigation found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many desperately unwell people are not getting effective treatment when they need it and employees are working in exhausting and unsafe conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Children’s Commissioner conducted a surprise visit in March 2021 and inspectors detailed their findings in a report in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report has not been published by the children’s watchdog but the Herald obtained a copy under the Official Information Act from Capital &amp; Coast DHB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We saw mokopuna and staff struggling to cope with the cramped, rundown, and decaying conditions at Rangatahi,” the inspectors said. “Whānau were ‘dismayed’ at the physical condition of the facility when they arrived.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff pointed out problems they claimed had been unresolved for years: Broken windows, crumbling window frames, windows covered over with plywood, missing curtains in girls’ bedrooms, a dysfunctional duress alarm, offensive graffiti and dilapidated furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indoor areas were cramped, while use of the limited outdoor space was restricted because there wasn’t enough staff to provide supervision, the inspectors noted. The food was monotonous and unsuitable. When patients wanted to call family, they had to use a phone outside the nurse’s station that lacked privacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspectors expressed concern some patients were detained in a “barren” seclusion area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has long been a practice in psychiatric units to manage agitated patients by physically restraining or locking them in a confined space until they settle, but there has been a push in recent years to eliminate these methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At RRAIS, a dozen patients over the previous year had been held for between 10 minutes and 68 hours in a confined area that was in poor condition, the inspectors found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temperature in the seclusion room was “noticeably cold”, despite some patients being held there in only a hospital gown. There was no outdoor space for secluded patients except for a “small cage covered with mesh” with no seating, that was “clearly visible from a public road”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given the age and vulnerability of mokopuna at Rangatahi and the conditions in the seclusion unit, we are seriously concerned about the use of seclusion,” the inspectors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff complained of high turnover, burnout, and frustration at “being unable to work to their job descriptions because they were too busy ‘trying to keep these kids alive’”. Patients told inspectors they weren’t getting the effective treatment they needed to get better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that visit, inspectors demanded a range of improvements including urgent refurbishment, elimination of the use of seclusion and restraint, and recruitment of new staff to ensure there were enough trained professionals on every shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, during a <b>Covid lockdown</b>, the Children’s Commissioner went back for another inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, inspectors found there’d been some progress: Staff culture had improved significantly, partly because of a change of leadership. Patients told the inspectors the staff were caring and supportive. And there appeared to be better planning and communication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the inspectors said the unit was still not a safe and therapeutic environment for vulnerable young people. While there had been cosmetic improvements since the previous review, including new carpets, repaired windows and renovations to an internal courtyard, the inspectors said they “remain concerned the building is not safe or fit for purpose”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The staffing situation remained “unsafe and unsustainable”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Staff regularly work overtime and described feeling burnt out and fatigued,” the January report said. “Many describe the current situation as unsafe and felt the unit would be unable to provide safe, quality care for mokopuna if they were at full capacity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of chronic understaffing, the use of seclusion and restraint had increased since their last visit, despite their recommendations, the inspectors said. There were 14 seclusion “events” in the six months before their latest inspection, a “significant increase”, the inspectors said. They lasted up to 54 hours and the youngest person put in confinement was 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions in the seclusion area were still cold and degrading, and required an “urgent upgrade”, the inspectors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also noted some patients were made to use cardboard potties. They found no clear reason or justification for this, but “it appeared to be routine”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Bergquist of Health <b>NZ</b> said: “RRAIS works hard to strike a balance between supporting and treating clients with complex conditions, while also ensuring the safety and protection of other vulnerable clients and staff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seclusion is only used as a “last resort, when rangatahi pose a risk to themselves or others, and when other de-escalation methods have proved unsuccessful”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was due to “three clients with very complex <b>mental health</b> needs”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bergquist said the use of cardboard potties was not standard practice. However, the bathroom could be a safety risk because “it can be locked from inside and has no viewing window, meaning staff cannot remain in contact with rangatahi who may be highly distressed”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In this instance, rangatahi will be provided with a composite material disposable receptacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we acknowledge that this process is far from ideal, it remains the safest option,” Bergquist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seclusion area is scheduled for refurbishment, which will include revamping the bathroom to protect the privacy and dignity of patients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political parties are trying to score pre-election points but none really deal with the elephant in the room — that the country’s infrastructure and broad administration are in crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article dealing with the nations’ firefighters (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 5) epitomised this slow downfall. Christchurch doesn’t have a serviceable high-ladder fire engine that can reach 32m, so the crew is using a converted cement mixer. We are clearly on a fast track to Third World standards. Our crumbling hospitals with patients dying in ED, and other horror stories, reinforces this impression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it too much to ask of the political parties to put their vastly expensive pet projects on hold (Three Waters and cycleways come to mind) and, rather, put <b>New Zealand</b> first for once and jointly return us to a properly functioning First World country?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johan Slabbert, Warkworth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that we are at the beginning of a quantum shift in the way people work. This is because we have no choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am categorically not a romantic or sentimentalist. It is healthier to be an optimist I have decided. So — there will be a recession — and, out the other side, I think we will see a stronger and more self-reliant population. It will be better in almost every single way.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poverty and violence</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all <span class="companylink">OECD</span> countries, <b>New Zealand</b> is ranked the worst for family violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make matters worse, only 33 per cent of family violence is reported. Poverty is cited as the prime cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With one third of New Zealanders barely able to afford to put food on the table, surely it’s time for the Government to act.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making a scene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Act Party deputy leader Brooke Van Velden (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 5) is clearly confused in her opposition to film production rebates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebate is not a handout. It is returning some of the money the overseas studio is spending here as an incentive to come all this way to shoot their film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, if a Hollywood studio spends $100 million making an Avatar sequel in <b>New Zealand</b> then the Screen Production Grant scheme gives them back up to 20 per cent. Through direct and indirect taxes on the thousands of highly-paid, skilled jobs and services provided by making the film here, the government still recoups much more than the rebate paid back. Everyone wins. That’s why countries all over the world are offering film production rebates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five Avatar films have poured about $740 million into the <b>NZ</b> economy for about $140 million in rebates. Isn’t that a gain? How does that constitute “taxpayer cash” being given away?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Van Velden’s claim “every dollar that’s spent on a subsidy for the Hollywood elite is a dollar not spent somewhere else in our economy” shows she has no idea how this works.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I live in the inner city in an apartment but I am very relieved the council has voted as it has regarding special character areas. It proposes protections for the character suburbs of Auckland. But even that may still be overturned, so the war is not won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Wilson has become a spokesman for this disgraceful piece of legislation (<b>NZ</b> Herald, July 5) when in November last year his viewpoint was headlined “What’s up with Labour and National’s ‘slum enabling act’?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour and National have taken a fundamental right away from every New Zealander who owns a house in an urban setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this law was passed, you knew what you were buying into when you bought your house by simply looking at the zoning of your property. That security has been removed at a stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law allows up to three houses of up to three storeys, closer to boundaries than now, without resource consent. As a neighbour, you have no say in that. Your privacy and sunlight could be gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do most property-owning New Zealanders realise this, and is that okay with them?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our inheritance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I usually agree with Simon Wilson but profoundly disagree with his piece “10 misunderstandings of the villa wars” and his claim that “character” is not “heritage”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heritage is not just what the law determines, but our inheritance of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uniqueness of our wooden suburbs developed because the city had on its doorstep the forested Waitākere Ranges, containing one of the finest timber trees in the world — the kauri. From early days the hills were ruthlessly exploited for their timber wealth and brought to steam-powered mills in Freemans Bay, considered to be amongst the most up-to-date in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s one of the reasons Auckland’s population doubled between 1895 and 1911.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be a tragedy if the kind of monstrosities appearing in outer suburbs like Glen Eden, New Lynn and Henderson started popping up amongst our wooden inner suburbs, their greater height and bulk and destroying the coherence of streetscapes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aucklanders are quite right to fight these proposed Government imperatives and the councillors who did so need congratulating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether these draconian instructions can be turned back remains to be seen; if not, current and future generations of Aucklanders will be the losers.</p>

</div><div class="author">AUT </div><div>625 words</div><div>7 July 2022</div><div>11:52</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research funded by the Ministry of Health examines the effectiveness of counselling treatments for gambling disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, released today, indicates that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Motivational Interviewing are both effective long-term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As well as reduced gambling behaviour, both treatments were associated with reduced negative effects on the participants' professional life, social life, family life, and physical health, which were maintained after two years," says principal researcher Associate Professor Maria Bellringer, Director of the AUT Gambling and Addictions Research Centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research to understand the characteristics of people who seek and benefit from these gambling interventions is an important next step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A randomised clinical trial - led by the AUT Gambling and Addictions Research Centre (<b>New Zealand</b>) in collaboration with researchers at <span class="companylink">Flinders University</span> (<b>Australia</b>) and the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span> (Canada) - was conducted as part of "real life' gambling treatment services offered by The Salvation Army Oasis throughout <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who contacted The Salvation Army Oasis for gambling help were recruited for the clinical trial. The 227 participants were assessed on four separate occasions - before they received gambling treatment, at the end of treatment, after one year and two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very few clinical trials on gambling treatments have followed participants longer than 12 months. This research is important in understanding whether the effects of these treatments are maintained over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Salvation Army Oasis National Operations Manager, Lisa Campbell says: "We were happy to participate in this robust research to evaluate the effectiveness of our two main treatment approaches."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers investigated the effectiveness of two gambling interventions within a service setting:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined low-intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) plus Cue Exposure Therapy (CET), conducted face-to-face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motivational Interviewing (MI) in a single face-to-face session, with follow-up phone sessions and a self-help workbook.&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A text-messaging "gambling relapse prevention' intervention was given to half of the participants, who received either CBT or MI, but did not provide any additional benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although <b>mental health</b> and quality of life improved, neither treatment changed co-existing substance abuse," says Bellringer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Holistic treatments dealing with substance use in conjunction with gambling-related issues might be important, as substance use is highly associated with gambling problems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a significant proportion of people will terminate gambling treatment before it is completed, noticeably fewer people dropped out of the Motivational Interviewing intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having an intervention where most sessions are provided by phone is unusual in a face-to-face gambling treatment service but may be beneficial for people with transport or childcare issues who find it difficult to access physical services," says Bellringer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Salvation Army Oasis' remote delivery methods like phone and online sessions have been beneficial during the <b>COVID</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> when clients were unable to seek in-person support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This research concludes that our counselling reduces gambling harm in the long-term and supports improved whānau relationships. We encourage people impacted by gambling harm to seek the support available," says Campbell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AUT Gambling and Addictions Research Centre, based at the university's North Campus, conducts research that informs policy, population health, secondary healthcare, and professional practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;h2&gt;Notes to the editor:&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a talk therapy that can help people manage problems by changing the way they think and behave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cue Exposure Therapy (CET) is a form of CBT where people are exposed to relevant cues or stimuli in an effort to extinguish conditioned responses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a collaborative conversational approach designed to help someone move from feeling ambivalent about changing a particular behaviour, to feeling that they need to change the behaviour, to believing that they can change the behaviour.</p>

</div><div class="author">Just a Thought </div><div>635 words</div><div>7 July 2022</div><div>09:53</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online <b>mental health</b> provider, Just a Thought, has launched its latest course - Managing Insomnia. Using cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), the course is being offered on the Just a Thought platform and is the first of its kind to be offered free in <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Insomnia affects around 25% of the population," says Just a Thought Clinical Lead, Anna Elders. "There are many causes, ranging from stress and anxiety to lifestyle factors. But more recently, <b>Covid</b> has led to heightened levels of distress which has caused a significant spike in the number of people looking for insomnia treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sleep is such an important part of our overall wellbeing and health resilience. Left untreated, it can lead to many other issues, including anxiety and depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of this, one of the symptoms of <b>Covid</b> is sleep disturbance both during the acute stage and through recovery, so we also see this course as an excellent way to help avoid the onset of long-term insomnia post <b>Covid</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a highly experienced CBT practitioner, Anna has increasing concerns about the rise in insomnia cases and lack of access to immediate solutions. "Overall, there's been a big increase in the number of New Zealanders experiencing <b>mental health</b> difficulties. Insomnia can be both a cause and symptom of <b>mental health</b> conditions, such as anxiety and depression - so this course has come at a time when it's desperately needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBT-i is a highly effective, evidence-based treatment with a 70-80% success rate. Sleeping medications can have harmful side-effects and the value of this course is that for some people, CBT-i treatment has proven to be more effective than medication. Importantly, it equips learners with a kete of skills they can use for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big factor preventing people from seeking treatment for insomnia is the cost and availability. CBT-i can be very difficult to access, with people either experiencing long wait times through the public sector, or high costs for treatment through private clinics. The beauty of this course is that it's free, so can be delivered anywhere, any time at zero cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 40,000 New Zealanders are already using Just a Thought to support their <b>mental wellbeing</b>. All courses are free, based on proven and effective cognitive behavioural therapy and are accessible online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a stressful and uncertain time in <b>New Zealand</b> and around the world," says Anna. "We're really pleased to be offering this course at no cost and feel very confident we can help many New Zealanders get a good night's sleep which will help improve and protect overall wellbeing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To learn more about this free course or to sign up, go to: www.justathought.co.<b>nz</b>[http://www.justathought.co.nz]
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further information:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All Just a Thought courses are designed by clinicians and based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) which looks at the interaction between our thoughts, feelings and behaviours. This is an evidence-based therapy that has been shown to be one of the most effective in helping people with depression and anxiety and other <b>mental health</b> conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;h2&gt;The Managing Insomnia course:&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This course teaches people how to improve their sleep using simple, effective and proven strategies based on cognitive behavioural therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managing Insomnia follows the same format as Just a Thought's other online CBT courses— illustrated stories supported by lesson summaries, practise exercises and additional resources. To make it more widely accessible, this course has just four lessons instead of the usual six lesson format, and has been adapted to use simple, practical language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This course is available for any New Zealander over 16 years old who is experiencing ongoing or acute difficulties with sleep.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Shopless Says 3.2% Unemployment Isn't The Whole Story For The <b>NZ</b> Job Market</span>
</div><div class="author">Shopless </div><div>773 words</div><div>6 July 2022</div><div>14:44</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As government statistics show the unemployment rate remains around 3.2%, employers are in the media saying they can't find employees, while employees take to social media to decry the lack of jobs or conflicts caused by mandates. Yet, Shopless is reporting continual increases in the number of vacancies advertised, so has set out to analyse why there is so much contention around the viability of the Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b> job market, and what it means in real terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See the spike in job listings that caused this analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp; Employment</span> (MBIE) gathers data to ascertain employment vacancies from four sites: Seek, Trade Me Jobs, Education Gazette and Kiwi Health. Yet, no data includes social media such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span> as a valid source for advertising vacancies, or alternative sites that list job vacancies such as Shopless or even the WINZ "Keep <b>New Zealand</b> Working" facility. Yet, this limited range of sources provides the data that influences decisions made by departments including the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of <b>NZ</b></span>, MBIE, Treasury and MSD.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This variation in where employees post vacancies, and where employees find jobs provides clues for why there are varying opinions around the true work situation in <b>New Zealand</b>. With Shopless seeing an increasing number of vacancies listed each day, it makes sense that they would want to use the data they are seeing and delve more into what the <b>New Zealand</b> job market is genuinely like for the average New Zealander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;h2&gt;Are Managers and Professionals in Most Demand?&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MBIE data shows that biggest areas of growth are management and professional workers. However, with "professional" being a huge category covering everyone with a tertiary qualification, this category includes teachers, electricians, neurosurgeons, and film animators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Source: MBIE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue with gaining accurate data for these industries is that vacancies are filled through a variety of means. While the education and healthcare sectors have set policies for filling professional positions, it would seem the more trade based professional positions are still filled through word of mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anecdotally there are fewer job applications for each vacancy, particularly in the education and health sectors. The Education Review Office (ERO) conducted a survey that found that the well-being of permanent educators has declined, with the greatest effect being on staff in Auckland. Yet, teacher turnover throughout <b>New Zealand</b> was decreasing until <b>COVID</b> and MBIE has stated that "entry to this profession has become very competitive with supply outstripping demand. This situation is unlikely to change significantly during the next five years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;h2&gt;Experienced healthcare workers in demand, but is the outlook bleak for admin staff?&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile the healthcare system continues to struggle to find staff, and regional towns continue to bear the brunt of the lack of trained and qualified staff. International medical graduates (IMGs) represent 42.1% of doctors on the <b>NZ</b> Medical Board register, and with border restrictions in place for two years, this has not allowed the normal steady growth in this area. <b>New Zealand</b> continues to struggle to have enough <b>mental health</b> professionals, which is partially due to the intensive training requirements and limited number of positions available in universities. This means that IMGs represent over 62% of hires in Psychiatric fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MBIE notes that "job prospects for personal/executive assistants are limited as employment is projected to decrease." However, MBIE also suggests that these administrator vacancies are either advertised directly through a business, advertised on TradeMe Jobs, or Seek - which ignores the number of positions filled via alternative methods, including word of mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the construction industry a quick glance at the jobs advertised through MBIE suggested sites shows only trade recruiters, so may not be an accurate reflection of actual jobs available. While there is high demand for construction work, issues around reduced supply chain for building materials may cause underutilisation and staff cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the overall state of employment in <b>New Zealand</b> is positive, for those in small businesses or industries strongly effected by changing spending habits due to COVD, the future is not certain. While MBIE online job data still shows a steady increase in vacancies, the decline in vacancies filled through Seek and TradeMe jobs may see small and medium businesses turning away from expensive recruitment options and changing their recruitment strategy to be more targeted. When this occurs, we should expect to see a reported drop in online job vacancies that may simply be government sources not keeping up with a change in where New Zealanders are looking for jobs.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A coroner has warned of the increased risk of <b>mental health</b> problems and suicidal ideation linked with cannabis use by teenagers following the death of a 14-year-old boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coroner Mary-Anne Borrowdale released her findings to Stuff with the hope of encouraging those who care for teenagers who use cannabis to make themselves aware of the risks and of ways to reduce that use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 14-year-old, whose name is suppressed, died in 2019. He had attempted suicide twice in the previous 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was about 4, the boy was referred for paediatric and psychiatric assessment over behavioural concerns, and suspicions of foetal alcohol syndrome and ADHD. It found him to be a "normal, energetic young boy".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, a further psychiatric assessment following disruptiveness at school found he was inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive. Records suggested the boy was a "fairly straightforward kid" until about 2016, when he became increasingly moody and defiant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was never formally diagnosed with a disability or <b>mental health</b> condition but received regular counselling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of his death, he had a half-day at school, so decided to stay home. That afternoon his girlfriend told him in a series of text messages that she did not feel in a position to continue their relationship. The teen twice texted he was going to kill himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She asked him not to do "anything stupid". About an hour later his adoptive mother asked if he would like to go into town with her. Upset, he told her he did not. She left him in his bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While she was out she was contacted by one of his friends who was worried he might hurt himself. She immediately returned home where she found the teen dead. Police noted a smell of cannabis in a shed at the property, while in his bedroom were various cannabis-related items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mother told police she was aware he smoked cannabis and she had told him she preferred he did so in their shed, rather than out on the street. There was no evidence as to the frequency of his cannabis use. Clinicians who treated the boy noted his birth mother had experienced difficulties with cannabis and alcohol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coroner said there was no evidence the teen's <b>mental health</b> support providers were addressing his use of cannabis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A risk management form from 2016 recorded him saying he did not use alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowdale said the young teen was experiencing "several stressors in his life", including difficulties with his schoolwork, and with his whanau and other relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coroner said it appeared from the teen's medical records he received "appropriate and supportive" <b>mental health</b> care and counselling following his first suicide attempt, and over the following 18 months until his death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[He] was a young teenager who had a history of experiencing moderate depression, with feelings of intense <b>isolation</b> and sadness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[He] was known to smoke cannabis with some regularity and he had smoked cannabis immediately prior to his death."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowdale cited research, including a 2011 study in <b>New Zealand</b>, that reported nearly 80% of young people had used cannabis before the age of 21. While it was not possible to detail what causative effect or contribution the teen's cannabis use made to his suicide, the coroner said there was evidence that cannabis use by teenagers was associated with "an increased risk".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An American paper that looked at people aged 18 to 35, between 2008 and 2019, found cannabis use was associated with increased risks of suicide, suicide planning and suicide attempts. A 2014 analysis of adolescent studies reported a "direct relation" between cannabis use and suicidal ideation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Adolescents who were daily cannabis users before age 17 years old had odds of suicide attempt that were seven times higher than for those young people who had never used cannabis," the coroner said. "Those who used cannabis weekly or more were four times more likely to attempt suicide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those who used cannabis monthly or more were over twice as likely to attempt suicide."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowdale said the studies were a "vital contribution to suicide prevention efforts". "We cannot know what contribution [the teen's] cannabis use may have made to his <b>mental health</b> or his suicide. But on the basis of these studies . . . I am not prepared to assume [his] cannabis use played no part at all in his tragic death."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is the <b>mental health</b> of staff and owners that is of most concern, says Egan, who is also national president of the Restaurant Association of <b>New Zealand</b>, Te Tao Roa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issue of <b>mental health</b> has manifested itself in the last few years like nothing I've ever seen in the 40 years I've been in this industry. It's been quite alarming amongst our members. It's one of the main issues. It's not just [their staff] but their own <b>mental health</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, a Restaurant Association survey from May showed 59% of the 566 members who responded reported their <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing was suffering as a result of the impact of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> on their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the young people that really suffer from it the most," says Egan. "Anxiety is the biggest issue. It's the perfect storm of the <b>pandemic</b>, the cost of living, their workload at university, and their future with student loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says members tell him staff will call up and say they can't come in or have to leave during their shift because they are overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're all running around trying to be really busy and someone rings in to say they can't work because of anxiety, and we say, okay, have a few days off, but we still have 100 people booked for dinner . . . We're down a waiter, and we have to cope with that, then we get anxiety, and it goes round and round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not going away. We just have to come up with strategies to deal with it and help our staff and ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to be sympathetic. The owners just have to take up the slack. Some of the other staff take up the extra shifts. We say come back to work when you're ready."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bayley, a 23-year-old hospitality worker, already struggled with <b>mental health</b>, but with study, work and the uncertainty that the <b>pandemic</b> heaped on her future, her anxiety has ramped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something had to give, and it couldn't be work because how would she pay her rising rent and food, she says. So after four years of architecture school she parked up her study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been really difficult to talk about <b>mental health</b> but being able to discuss it with her managers has been her "saving grace", says Bayley, who wanted only her first name used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Mental health</b> is looming large in the hospitality industry right now. That's Alistair Boyce, owner of the Backbencher Gastropub, Cellar-Vate cafe and The Immigrant's Son Espresso talking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd say 30-40% of my staff suffer from some form of <b>mental health</b> issue related to two-and-a-half years of lockdowns and <b>Covid</b> and all the anxiety that comes with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are kids who are trying to work while doing their education remotely, while trying to pay high rents and afford expensive food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are coming through education and employment with no immediate hope in sight. Previous generations used to be able to look forward to OEs and owning their own home and enjoying an income . . . and a future they could aspire to. At the moment the hope and aspiration of our economy and our social economy is at an all-time low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't help that business was sporadic, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could double your turnover in a week and halve it the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Then you have to try and staff it and the staff are going to have anxiety around that because none of us know, day to day, how busy we are going to be or how much support we need or how many staff we have got to cater. It's a time of incredible stress."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had the usual staff turnover but no new workers to employ, says Boyce, whose staff had already endured abuse and disruption to shifts during the anti- mandate protests at Parliament in February and March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government needed to open up the borders earlier to keep up with the rest of the world because that was an international labour market that we compete in, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need the rest of the world coming in and out of [Aotearoa].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really important otherwise you're going to see CBDs turning into ghettos. You can see that in the life on the street. It's getting very ghetto-like and at times it's downright dangerous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Backbencher is closed on the weekends now and Boyce is considering closing a week night as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a week-by-week, day-by-day process of managing the staff I've got and what they can handle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the most difficult period trading and managing staff I've ever known in hospitality, and I've been in the industry for more than 40 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a business owner, the fall-out from <b>Covid</b> has definitely taken its toll on her <b>mental health</b>, says Diana Parker, of Sweet Mother's Kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was the pressure during <b>Covid</b> of trying to maintain the business, make the right decisions, honour staff contracts, keep them busy but not overly busy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hospitality has always been a bit of a rollercoaster, but now it's much harder to gauge what's going to happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She made the call to close on Saturday night last week because of a lack of staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had one staff down, you can't get temp chefs and there's no point in ruining people just to keep your business open. There's so much doom and gloom out there . . . but customers have been a lot more patient with a generous spirit," says Parker, who acknowledged while hospo was suffering there were lots of others out there doing it tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a lot of pressure on people in the industry, says Stephen Edwards, general manager at the Wellesley Boutique Hotel, cafe and bar. "Because we're running the business so lean and so close to the bone and everyone else is doing the same thing, there's pressure for us all to perform and not call in sick . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had staff that have had to take time out because this has all got on top of them. I've been under a lot of pressure as well. I get eczema when I get stressed and that's been playing up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edwards says he's "trimmed all the fat" out of the business. The hotel's cafe is open only four hours a day and it is closed on Mondays now. "I'm killing off parts of the business that were just marginally profitable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The staffing issue is affecting cafes and restaurants all over town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitol restaurant is open five nights a week and would open for lunch service if staffing levels weren't so tight, says executive chef and co-owner Tom Hutchison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff leave and sickness were issues to consider when opening for service, but it was also a "lean customer base" that put him off opening more often, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masala Cafe &amp; Bar had cut back to opening five nights since February because of staffing issues and was just this week back to six nights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egmont Street Eatery has cut back two lunchtime services because of staff sickness and a lack of workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charley Noble said this week it would be closing for lunch service on Monday and Tuesday for six weeks in an effort to look after their staff during an ongoing labour shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ortega Fish Shack has dropped from opening five nights a week to four nights for the next two months because their kitchen was low on chefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Field &amp; Green closed for lunch on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays since the start of the <b>pandemic</b> and has only recently reopened on Fridays. They are closed two days a week to give staff a decent break, says co-owner Raechal Ferguson. They had managed people being off sick and staff had 'stepped up' to fill in the gaps, including chefs coming out to do front-of-house work, says Ferguson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost of living bites</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of everything else the industry was struggling with rising costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Edwards' coffee supplier broke it to him that he was increasing the price of coffee beans by 20% on July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had put up coffee prices at the Wellesley cafe at the beginning of the year. He won't be putting up prices again any time soon, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel for everyone else with the cost of living. Everyone's struggling and I want to do the best I can to hold the prices down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parker says she will have to rework Sweet Mother's Kitchen menu to manage the costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bunch of emails in her inbox from suppliers told of price increases - everything's gone up across the board, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's happened so quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone is experiencing cost increases from their suppliers, says Egan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coffee, meat, fish - up, up, up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone is worried about the cost and supply of flour because of the war in Ukraine, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooking oil has gone up - so much so that Egan is buying in bulk and sharing the costs with fellow restaurateurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of containers has gone up. Where before he could bring a container from China full of glasses and restaurant hardware for $5000, the importers are tripling that, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone is looking at their menu. You put up your prices where you have to and customers are really understanding, Egan says. In fact, they are tipping like Rockefellers to show their appreciation for what the industry is coping with right now. Sometimes it's easier to strip things off the menu. No more crayfish at Monsoon Poon for now after the price jumped from $110 to $145 a kilo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants didn't want to price themselves out of customers' reach. People need and want to go out, says Egan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Spence talks to Sir Peter Gluckman about his grave concerns over teenagers’ <b>mental health</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> is facing another <b>pandemic</b> of “overwhelming magnitude” as the numbers of children and teenagers with poor <b>mental wellbeing</b> increase, one of the country’s most influential scientists has warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sir Peter Gluckman, a leading paediatrician and former adviser to National and Labour governments, says the breakdown of child and adolescent <b>mental health</b> services exposed by the Weekend Herald is a product of a bigger crisis among young people that has been brewing for years and amplified by <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s the tip of the iceberg,” Gluckman says, referring to an investigation that last week revealed how specialist <b>mental health</b> services across the country are crumbling as more young people seek help for serious mental conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising numbers of children and teens experiencing depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm and other major problems is the sharp end of a wider issue, Gluckman says: many more young people now have poorer emotional wellbeing, and are less psychologically resilient, than previous generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The real <b>pandemic</b> that is emerging is this <b>pandemic</b> of loss of subjective wellbeing in that critical stage of life, adolescence, which is affecting 25 to 40 per cent of Western populations,” Gluckman told the Weekend Herald from Paris, where he chairs the International Science Council, a non-governmental organisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While more young people are experiencing serious <b>mental health</b> problems, there’s a much larger group who don’t have a diagnosable clinical problem but are struggling to cope with stress in ways that could profoundly affect their education, health, relationships and futures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates of young people with poor emotional wellbeing have doubled or tripled in recent years, depending on which data you look at, Gluckman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <b>New Zealand</b>, the latest version of the national Youth2000 survey, carried out in 2019, found that the rate of secondary students with symptoms of depression rose from 13 per cent to 23 per cent in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All these surveys are showing exactly the same trends,” Gluckman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is happening across high-income countries — “<b>New Zealand</b> is not standing out here as being particularly different” — for reasons that are not yet well understood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Social media, smartphones and other technological advances are often blamed, but experts believe a host of complex, interrelated factors are at play, including changes in how children are brought up and increased stress on parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The stresses of childhood and adolescence are now far greater than they were 50 years ago,” Gluckman says — but young people have not been given the emotional resilience early in life to be able to cope with those pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gluckman is so concerned about the rising tide of mental distress that he rates it as one of the biggest risks the world faces, up there with infectious diseases, violent conflicts and climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet he doesn’t think any government is responding to the problem with sufficient urgency — including <b>New Zealand</b>’s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The issues of young people’s <b>mental health</b> are going to overwhelm every country,” Gluckman says. “Just overwhelm them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Weekend Herald’s investigation found that child and adolescent <b>mental health</b> services run by district health boards across the country are more stretched than ever after the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> outbreak, with some reaching “crisis point”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviews with people across the sector and documents obtained from numerous health authorities showed that a surge in referrals and drastic shortages of skilled clinicians has undermined the quality of care, putting patients at risk and causing staff to burn out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This has been an orphan service for 30 years,” Gluckman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while he agrees more investment and recruitment are needed in specialist <b>mental health</b> services for the people who desperately need treatment, he argues that alone will not come close to resolving the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvements to services, he says, must be accompanied by an enormous increase in the amount of attention and funding given to prevention and early intervention, to stop <b>mental health</b> problems developing in young people in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This includes more support for pregnant mothers, improved early childhood education, teaching resilience in schools, using digital technology to deliver therapy, and restricting the availability of alcohol to young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nobody is showing an interest in doing the proper work that needs to be done to understand the factors in play,” Gluckman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s all very well to say we need more psychologists or counsellors — and don’t get me wrong, we need them for the kids who are falling off the cliff, of course we do — but we’ve got to stop people getting to the edge of the cliff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s not really much thinking going on in <b>New Zealand</b> about preventative <b>mental health</b> for young people,” he adds. “And that’s a much more complex and yet more urgent issue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 2019 Wellbeing Budget, Labour made “taking <b>mental health</b> seriously” a top policy priority and allocated $1.9 billion to the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its main policy in the area is the “Access and Choice” initiative, which provides early intervention in primary care settings for people with mild or moderate <b>mental health</b> difficulties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gluckman did not specifically criticise the policy, but said the government’s overall approach to <b>mental health</b> — like that of its predecessors — has been too narrow. “I think every government, whether it’s left or right, [Jacinda] Ardern, [John] Key, [Bill] English, [Helen] Clark, whatever, they always want to be seen to make singular programmes that work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We remain superficially focused on quick wins,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resolving the <b>mental health</b> crisis, Gluckman says, will require a concerted, bipartisan effort across all government departments for several decades, spanning prevention, early intervention and treatment. It will be difficult, he says — there is not a “silver bullet” — but it is achievable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s a systems approach. It’s not just health, it’s education, it’s social welfare, it’s housing, it’s justice, it’s alcohol reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s a lot of areas that are part of it. If you just look at health alone, we will not solve the problem.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s just like climate change,” Gluckman adds. “If you just focus on methane production from cows, you’re not going to solve the problem.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gluckman, who now runs the think tank Koi Tū: The Centre for Informed Futures at the <span class="companylink">University of Auckland</span>, was National’s chief science adviser for nearly a decade. In 2017, near the end of his term, he published a report calling for a cross-government approach to <b>mental health</b> that warned <b>New Zealand</b> as a whole did not grasp the severity of the problem. And it still doesn’t, he believes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the magnitude of the problem is still grossly underestimated,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And the implications for the long-term health of <b>New Zealand</b> society are grossly underestimated.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congratulations to Brian Fallow on his column “Spendthrift Robertson — says who?” (<b>NZ</b> Herald, June 24).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National (the party of pop-up leaders) is looking more and more like the American Republican party in pandering to its voter base at a cost to national wellbeing. They are part of the “lower taxes and run like a business” set of mantra floggers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour also panders to its voter base by looking the other way when problems arise with certain segments of the population, but, for the time being, is more convincing than National in its general focus on the wider interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have plenty of experience of businesses letting us down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Air <b>New Zealand</b></span> suffered like all other airlines from the <b>Covid</b> restrictions, but has a long history of squeezing out competitors and occasionally needing to be rescued by the taxpayer. We have had a long string of other businesses that have abandoned subcontractors and investors. The attitude expressed by some CEOs in written articles was that their only obligation was to shareholders, and ethics were irrelevant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us run the country ethically and in the interests of all levels of society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low-wage economy suited the asset strippers, but it has magnified poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hugh Webb, Huntington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sense of proportion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest OECD Economic Report confirms <b>New Zealand</b> as a very low-producing country compared to other nations of similar size. We also lack expertise in many sectors and our supposed number 8 wire mentality is just about non-existent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History portrays this tendency to lose important skills and attitudes when there is a mildly socialist-leaning government in place. Labour has approved over 30 billion dollars of infrastructure projects in Auckland and Wellington. This is over the next 25 to 30 years. It will be double and take nearly twice as long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at any project worldwide of similar magnitude in a small populated country and you only see disaster. We will need help from China or Korea as the major project constructors to achieve anything like the projections. They have the skills and machinery to do it. In addition, it is absurd to predict so far ahead in the modern world. Smaller steps would be more appropriate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although we are a small nation with a big heart, trying to make such huge predictions with massive debts is a disaster for future Kiwis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Lewis-Wilson, Mangōnui.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservatism collides</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have no desire to enter the very contentious fray of Roe vs Wade, but rational dialogue does matter and it could conceivably set a precedent for further incursions into civil liberties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Supreme Court, comprised of purportedly the finest legal minds in the country, should have considered the following facts. Fewer than half of US high schools and less than a fifth of middle schools teach all 20 topics recommended by the CDC as essential components of sex education, and abstinence is the predominant tool in the curriculum for avoiding unwanted pregnancies used in 35 out of 50 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? In American women aged 15 to 19, five out of every six pregnancies are accidents, and 92 per cent of those are conceived pre-maritally. When conservatism collides with logic and reason, this is the outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the Federal Government prepared to mop up the educational, societal, and healthcare messes that will ensue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember the facile argument that guns don’t kill, people do. Look how well that’s working. God bless America. It will need all the blessings God can bestow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Hearn, Glendowie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other side</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is it okay for politicians and celebrities to criticise the repeal of Roe v Wade, some in the crassest of ways, and yet not for those who passionately believe abortion to be evil to celebrate or even comment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have we reached a stage when only one viewpoint is acceptable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do we want to live in a voluntary North Korea where any divergence from controlled thought is vindictively punished? So much for genuine diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark McCluskey, Red Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secure units</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letter from Gary Hollis (<b>NZ</b> Herald, June 22) regarding <b>mental health</b> and institutions is timely and disturbing. Institutions like Lake Alice, Tokanui and Kingseat were no doubt run as well-meaning places where those who needed special care would receive it. The reality was that patients were sometimes admitted with illnesses that were not fully understood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During my youth in the 1940s and 50s, <b>mental health</b> was seldom talked about. A boy about my age was placed in Tokanui and stayed there for 20-odd years until he was correctly diagnosed with a muscular condition which prevented him from living a normal life. In the language of those times, he was considered an idiot and was kept in a secure unit. Eventually, he was rediagnosed, released from care and lived his life out at home with his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don’t know why <b>mental health</b> and suicide is such a problem today but as an 80-plus-year-old who has a body which aches most days, I know that life is a gift to be embraced and treasured. The last thing we need is institutions like those above.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncomfortable ride</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the article on the Upper Highway Drive cycleway by Simon Wilson (<b>NZ</b> Herald, June 28) I would like to make the following comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living on the North Shore which has limited cycleways, the approximately 4.5km cycleway is one of the most enjoyable places to ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traffic is limited, there has been (until the barriers were installed) a 1.5m cycleway with an 0.5m buffer zone (delineated by road markings) and passing was possible on this buffer zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Installation of the buffers has made this cycleway single-file cycling. The cycleway is now strewn with rubbish and sometimes wheelie bins. To avoid these and passing slow cyclists entails passing between barriers — itself a potential risk (hitting a barrier) — and entering the carriageway travelling wider out on to the road with an increased risk of an accident with a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No serious accidents occurred since the cycleway was established in 2013 until recently when a competitive cyclist was injured by striking a barrier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps Wilson should devote his attention to ideas to improve the Albany Highway/Upper Harbour Drive junction, which is probably the most dangerous intersection for cyclists in <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Pollock, Takapuna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems incongruous that the speed limit on the Waikato Expressway is to be increased to 110km/h.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government has declared a Climate Emergency and the IPCC report 2022 said only the most drastic cuts in carbon emissions from now would help prevent an environmental disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely adopting a nationwide decrease in speed limit to 80km/h would be more consistent with the Climate Commission’s advice, and help preserve a liveable planet for future generations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin Treadwell, Waiheke Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soulless development</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current debate regarding the preservation of old heritage and classic housing versus densification is really a fight between young and old entitled middle-class people. I tend to side with the preservation lobby, being affected by the debate myself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, while we have concentrated on trying to densify central Auckland with what will become soulless high rises, and with endless debates about overly expensive light rail tunnels, we have been neglecting the rest of Auckland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We really need to get those people from South Auckland to the Māngere employment hub. We should extend the Onehunga line so the people in Māngere can commute to Te Papapa, Penrose and Ellerslie; with the proposed Avondale to Southdown freight line the south could be connected to the west; and we have neglected the northwest by denying a rail link to Huapai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have been arguing about light rail and densification since 2014 and nothing has gone forward. We need to be dealing with climate change and social equity through quality transport options for all. Not trying to shoehorn some young, entitled, middle-class people into central city properties at the expense of everyone else.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since May 2021, the "GoodYarn Community' programme has brought together over 250 locals from different community sectors to talk about <b>mental health</b> and arm themselves with more knowledge, strategies and skills to help them stay mentally well and support others who are struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed and delivered by the Queenstown-based Southern Wellbeing Trust, in partnership with the Good Programmes Trust (<span class="companylink">GPT</span>), the objective of the pilot was to increase <b>mental health</b> knowledge and skills across the district, prioritising those who were most vulnerable, to help combat the widespread <b>mental health</b> effects of <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and build resilience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilot was based on the <span class="companylink">GPT</span>'s award-winning, evidence-based GoodYarn <b>mental health</b> education programme, which has been successfully delivered to large workplaces and rural communities since 2007. The pilot was designed with input from local agencies, and the content adapted to suit individuals, community leaders, cultural groups, new and expectant parents, and small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of the pilot is largely credited to the use of peer facilitators - community members with relevant lived experience or skills who can relate closely to the group they're working with and deliver the information in a language, time and place that suits them. This community-led approach has proven particularly successful with traditionally hard-to-reach groups and diverse cultures and has received widespread endorsement and support from local organisations and trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the pilot ending on 30 June 2022, a new charitable entity - the Head Light Trust - has been formed to focus on refining the GoodYarn Community programme so that it can be scaled up and rolled out to empower more communities to support their <b>mental wellbeing</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna Dorsey, co-founder of the Southern Wellbeing Trust, is the new Chief Executive of Head Light and will lead its team of operations staff and community-based GoodYarn facilitators. She will exit the Southern Wellbeing Trust and co-founder Dr Tim Rigg will remain as its Director, continuing his important work of researching and building other innovative and community-led approaches to support <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna says her team is relishing the challenge of developing GoodYarn into a sustainable <b>mental health</b> education programme that other towns and communities can benefit from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The <b>mental health</b> impacts of <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> have been tough and will continue for some time yet. But we're seeing firsthand the tangible benefits GoodYarn Community is bringing - it's creating a ripple effect of <b>mental health</b> education across our communities and we want to help share it more widely," she explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna notes that as word spreads, they're seeing more demand for the programme, with some local community organisations now looking to embed the workshop into their own training schedule for volunteers and members, "which is fantastic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This programme is all about prevention, early intervention and staying well. We can't think of a better outcome than as many New Zealanders as possible having the skills and confidence to shine a light on <b>mental health</b> and be able to help themselves and those around them who are struggling," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data shows that the workshops have achieved consistently high quality learning outcomes, with 97% of participants stating that the workshops have increased their knowledge of <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's the qualitative data that has really moved Anna and her team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hearing stories from so many of our participants about how it's helped them personally and helped them to talk with people around them who are having a tough time, has only strengthened our conviction to make this programme available to as many people as possible," said Anna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Feedback</span> shows that in just one three-hour workshop, people come away with better insights into <b>mental health</b>, their own behaviour and some coping strategies for themselves and ways to support their whānau, friends, neighbours, and colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our goal is to keep building on this successful foundation and the learnings we've gained, and grow GoodYarn Community into a sustainable programme that can support community <b>mental wellbeing</b> on a much larger scale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Head Light Trust team will continue to host GoodYarn workshops, it will also be building up its organisational structure and governance, including developing a funding strategy that supports a sustainable business model and secures appropriate funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Head Light team will continue to work with Ember Innovations*, a specialist entity that supports entrepreneurial initiatives to improve the <b>mental health</b> and <b>mental wellbeing</b> of people in Aotearoa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Annual plan 2022/23 was presented to the House of Representatives today. This annual plan is a key accountability document for our Office. It describes the discretionary work we consider will help us to achieve our ultimate outcome - that Parliament and the public can have trust and confidence in <b>New Zealand</b>'s public sector. This discretionary work includes performance audits, special studies, our sector reports, and good practice guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We finalised this annual plan after seeking feedback from Parliament, public organisations, and the public. The topics we intend to look at in the next year are those we think are important to New Zealanders, which was confirmed by the feedback we received on our draft annual plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topics we have included in our work programme include child poverty, family and sexual violence, housing and urban development projects, climate change, and <b>mental health</b> and addiction services for young people. We will also continue to review the effectiveness of the Government's response to, and <b>New Zealand</b>'s recovery from, the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>. Our Office is also interested in understanding how well the public sector is delivering outcomes that matter for Māori, including public organisations' preparedness to meet Treaty settlement obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, we will be agile and responsive to unexpected events and emerging issues during 2022/23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This annual plan focuses on where we believe we can make the best contribution, as an independent public watchdog, to supporting trust and confidence in the public sector as it goes about its work. Our work will help Parliament and the public hold public organisations to account for their performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A media kit is also available for this report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exclusive Officials told DHB to create turnaround plan for under-pressure site</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about understaffing at a <b>mental health</b> service that treated a 37-year-old man accused of killing a mother of four in Christchurch were escalated to the Minister of Health Andrew Little, the Herald has learned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a briefing on January 20, officials at the Ministry of Health told the minister that the workforce at the Canterbury regional forensic <b>mental health</b> service was so stretched that its secure psychiatric facility at Hillmorton Hospital was operating only 12 of its 15 beds and “running a waitlist for acutely unwell patients”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald understands the man accused of killing Laisa Waka Tunidau, 52, in what police have described as a “random attack” in the suburb of Sockburn on Saturday was treated in the Hillmorton forensic facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Canterbury DHB, Dr Peter Bramley, confirmed in a statement yesterday that the man “was a patient of the DHB’s specialist <b>mental health</b> service based at Hillmorton, who had been on community leave”, but did not provide further details about his care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DHB is carrying out a full review, Bramley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January briefing to Little followed a series of media reports about unsafe conditions and staff departures at the Hillmorton forensic facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the document, officials from the ministry visited the hospital on January 19, where they discussed problems with the DHB’s leadership and were assured it was working with staff and unions to “put a strong contingency plan in place”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry later wrote to the DHB’s chief executive asking for a turnaround plan with “short, medium, and long-term actions which will be closely monitored”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The underlying issue appears to be staff have left and are not being replaced,” officials told Little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a problem across the entire Canterbury <b>mental health</b> service, it noted, with 100 full-time positions vacant in a <b>mental health</b> workforce of around 1100 at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems at Hillmorton were indicative of wider pressures on forensic <b>mental health</b> services nationally, the officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>’s five regional forensic inpatient services were “under considerable occupancy pressures”, running at an average occupancy of 104 per cent, officials told the minister in a related memo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since that briefing in January, the pressures on forensic services have continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strain illustrated how publicly funded <b>mental health</b> providers across the country are struggling to cope with increasing numbers of people seeking their help at a time when there is a shortage of skilled and experienced health professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also raised questions about the safety of some of the most unwell people in the <b>mental health</b> system, the staff who care for them, and the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald obtained the briefings as part of a six-month investigation into the state of <b>mental health</b> services, which has included interviews with dozens of service users, carers, clinicians, researchers, and officials, a review of data from more than 25 public bodies, and an examination of thousands of pages of government and health authority documents, many of which have not been made public before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a series of articles in recent weeks, the Herald has exposed how the specialist services were weakened by years of underfunding, understaffing, and poor planning and are now failing to respond to an increase in demand that has been amplified by the <b>coronavirus pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five regional forensic services, operated by the Canterbury, Capital &amp; Coast, Southern, Waikato, and Waitematā DHBs, exist at the hard end of this system, responsible for some of the most acutely unwell, risky, disadvantaged, and hard-to-treat patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nature of their work requires intensive staffing and a high level of supervision and security. However, officials say resources have been constrained by: The shortages of psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and other experienced staff; historic underinvestment in inpatient beds; more people being sent directly to forensic units by the courts; and an increase in the number of acutely unwell inmates in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forensic psychiatrists said they’ve been overburdened by the growth of the prison population in recent decades. Nine out of ten prisoners were estimated to have some form of <b>mental health</b> problem, most have never received adequate treatment, and many deteriorate badly while they are in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the resources put into <b>mental health</b> care provided by Corrections and DHBs’ forensic psychiatric services haven’t kept up with the growing need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a prisoner becomes severely acutely mentally unwell — for example if they’re experiencing an episode of psychosis — they should be transferred to a secure psychiatric facility. But there are so few beds in forensic units and those beds are in such high demand that prisoners are instead put on waiting lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, psychiatrists said, prisoners with severe acute psychosis have been made to wait for weeks without treatment in solitary <b>lockdown</b> where they cannot keep up basic self-care and become disturbed and aggressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a joint editorial in the <b>New Zealand</b> Medical Journal in March 2020, the clinical directors of the regional forensic services described this as a “serious — arguably scandalous — <b>mental health</b> crisis with few options for relief in sight” and called for an urgent government response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canterbury DHB’s head of specialist <b>mental health</b> services acknowledged the pressures this was having on the Hillmorton facility, Te Whare Manaaki, at a meeting of a public oversight committee in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Probably the highest risk area in terms of access to services,” the executive told the committee, according to the minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The team has changed how it operates with a greater focus on flow through the system. We are moving people through from that service into a rehabilitation service more quickly to create some of the space. The risk sits with people potentially being in Corrections, needing our services, but not having access to a bed. That has always been a tension point, but that tension has got higher.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the increase in demand for forensic services comes more strain on staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the briefing to Little, employees have been leaving the Hillmorton service “for a variety of reasons”, including maternity leave, other jobs in <b>mental health</b>, roles supporting the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> response, and refusal to comply with vaccine mandates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But union representatives and former staff said stress, burn out, and safety concerns were a major factor in the departures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January memo said the DHB’s contingency planning at the forensic facility “includes the use of overtime and bringing staff in from other areas to cover shifts. The DHB is also utilising healthcare assistants and is in the process of recruiting peer workers to provide cover.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki Dent, acting head of specialist <b>mental health</b> services at Canterbury DHB, told the Herald recruitment is the “highest priority” for the department and several new staff were being brought in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a national shortage of nursing staff across many regions and health specialties,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are multiple reasons for this and we are working with the Ministry of Health, who are aware of our staffing pressures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Arran Culver, the Ministry of Health’s acting deputy director general for <b>mental health</b>, said: “It is fair to say that the pressure on forensic <b>mental health</b> services remains high, and we recognise that teams across the country are working extremely hard to maintain high quality support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This includes services working together nationally and sharing resources where needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Ministry of Health, and now the new health entities [after the national health restructuring], have detailed work programmes to build the capability and capacity of the <b>mental health</b> and addiction workforce, including specialist services.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“However,” Culver added, “the results of this investment will take time, and there are still challenges with forensic <b>mental health</b> services recruitment in all disciplines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At this time of year, teams are also being impacted by winter illnesses and <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>. The ministry is working closely with services as they address the areas of pressure.”</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Soup-er Wellness Wednesday Vaccination Clinics Extended To End Of Winter</span>
</div><div class="author">Taranaki District Health Board </div><div>659 words</div><div>29 June 2022</div><div>15:05</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the success of Soup-er Wellness Wednesday at the New Plymouth and Hāwera vaccination centres throughout June, Taranaki DHB is extending the vaccination incentive to happen every Wednesday for the rest of Winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feedback about the clinic has been extremely positive. A parent who attended Soup-er Wellness Wednesday earlier this month said, "We had an amazing experience at the vaccination hub. We came in to get my children (both 9) their second <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> vaccination. Friendly check in and then pretty much straight into a children's room with nurse Lou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All three of us also took the opportunity to get our annual flu jab while we were there. Lou was fantastic with the kids. While there were a few tears, everyone walked out feeling proud of themselves knowing that we've done the best we can to protect our family's health this winter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free flu shots are already available for everyone over the age of 65 and those at risk of becoming seriously ill or who have underlying conditions. From Friday 1 July free flu vaccinations will also be available for children aged 3-12 years and people with serious <b>mental health</b> or addiction needs-.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Catherine Jackson, Taranaki DHB medical officer of health said, "I strongly recommend people get vaccinated against the flu to reduce their risk of being infected, so I am thrilled to see free flu vaccines announced for children aged 3-12 years. This is a big step forward for protecting whānau through the winter months and improving equity for Māori and Pasifika."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She adds, "While pre-school and primary school-aged children have the highest rates of influenza in the community, hospitalisations are highest in the very young, older people, and people with ongoing health conditions. Vaccinating children against flu and <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> will help protect the rest of your family from flu as children transmit flu to those around them even if they are not very sick themselves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and flu at the same time significantly increases your risk of hospitalisation and death, so now is a good time to check you are vaccinated against both viruses. People are also being reminded that if it has been three months since they (or their whānau) have had <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>, they can now get their next vaccination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no need to book an appointment - just walk-in to the New Plymouth Vaccination Centre (Baker Tilly Building, 109 Powderham Street) or the Hāwera Vaccination Centre (TSB Hub, Camberwell Road).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, people can get their vaccinations at their GPs, pharmacies, Māori health providers, or any of the Winter Wellness Clinics happening in communities throughout Taranaki over the coming months. More information about these community drop-in clinics can be found at www.tdhb.org.<b>nz</b>[http://www.tdhb.org.nz].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone who has a <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>, flu or measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination on Wednesdays in July and August at either vaccination centre will receive a nourishing cup of soup, bread and a winter wellness pack to help combat winter ills and chills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Packs will include all sorts of helpful items, including tissues, hand sanitiser, rapid antigen tests (RATs), face masks, coffee sachets and more. Spot prizes of winter-warmer items like hot water bottles, beanies, bed socks (etc.) will also be available on these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Crowe, Taranaki <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> Vaccination Programme clinical team leader says, "Vaccinations are a safe, easy and effective way to help you and your whānau stay well this winter. So, come on down to the Vaccinations Centres in New Plymouth and Hāwera or to our Winter Wellness Clinics around the maunga. We look forward to seeing you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If people have any special requirements due to disability, impairment or long-term health conditions, they can email <b>Covid</b>.VacEnquiries@tdhb.org.<b>nz</b> and our staff will make arrangements to meet their needs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lingering effects of the <b>Covid</b><b>- 19 pandemic</b> have led to a surge in the number of small-business owners who are struggling with their <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's something Tristin Anderson, the owner of Christchurch barbecue restaurant Smokey T's, knows all too well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being a small-business owner in <b>New Zealand</b> is very difficult," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Take out <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, inflation and interest rates that increase with no finish lines in sight - of course I have stress and anxiety."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is not alone. New insights from the MYOB 2022 Business Monitor - a survey of more than 1000 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - show that about a third of SME owners and operators have experienced a <b>mental health</b> condition since starting or taking over their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">MYOB</span>, an accounting platform, found that of those who had experienced a <b>mental health</b> condition, 85% reported being affected by stress, up 9% compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety was experienced by 71%, an increase of 7%, and 39% had experienced depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most SMEs surveyed said <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> had affected their wellbeing the most, holding onto the top spot from 2021. This was followed by a lack of sleep (35%) and workload (29%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep things positive in the workplace, Anderson said his company's ethos was to create a family-like work environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Which means we can engage with our staff on a personal level to create a place we believe to be another home away from home," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business also sponsored Champions for Life in Aranui, because Anderson said staying active supported <b>mental health</b>. The programme supplied sporting groups in the community with vouchers for players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For myself personally, I am a very positive person and try to project my positivity to my staff and to my patrons," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">MYOB</span> head of employee services Felicity Brown said running a business could be rewarding, but growing pressures could have a significant effect on owners' wellbeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the current economic environment, with the cost of living and inflation rising - coupled with growing workloads - it is understandable SMEs will be feeling overwhelmed, which is leading to increases in stress and anxiety. But it's important for business owners and leaders to remember they're not alone and support is available."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a significant proportion of SME owners or leaders experiencing <b>mental health</b> struggles, the research found that most SMEs were not actively discussing <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing in the workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-quarters said they had not discussed <b>mental wellbeing</b> and support with their staff over the past 12 months, while just a quarter said they had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Mental Health</b> Foundation</span> chief executive Shaun Robinson said it was understandable that small businesses were feeling the effects of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, and he encouraged them to focus on creating a workplace where <b>mental wellbeing</b> took centre stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'll need to communicate and engage with staff, so together you can bring about change in the workplace," he said. "Good <b>mental health</b> of business owners and staff leads to better engagement, reduced absences and higher productivity while improving people's wellbeing, morale and job satisfaction."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lingering impacts of the <b>COVID</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> have led to a surge in the number of local SME owners and operators experiencing stress and anxiety, according to new research from business management platform, MYOB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New insights from the MYOB 2022 Business Monitor - a survey of more than 1,000 local SMEs - has revealed around a third (32%) of SME owners and operators have experienced a <b>mental health</b> condition since starting or taking over their business.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">MYOB</span>'s data also revealed younger generations of business owners seem to be more comfortable talking about <b>mental health</b>, than their older counterparts. Nearly two fifths (38%) of Gen Y and Gen Z SME owners have discussed <b>mental wellbeing</b> and support with their employees over the past 12 months, compared to 29% of Gen X SMEs and just 20% of Baby Boomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Mental Health</b> Foundation</span>'s Chief Executive, Shaun Robinson says, "A healthy and thriving business requires <b>mental wellbeing</b> policies to be made a priority. Good <b>mental health</b> leads to better engagement, reduced absenteeism and higher productivity, while improving people's wellbeing, morale and job satisfaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During these challenging times we encourage all SMEs to create a workplace where <b>mental wellbeing</b> takes centre stage. It may feel daunting initially as you juggle the challenges of running a business. You'll need to communicate and engage with your staff so together you can begin to make change.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;h2&gt;Workplace wellbeing initiatives still low&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflective of last year's findings, the 2022 MYOB Business Monitor found that only a handful of SMEs have implemented new <b>mental wellbeing</b> support for their team members over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 10% of SMEs have put in place new <b>mental wellbeing</b> initiatives or support for employees over the 12 months prior to the survey, whereas 84% of SMEs have not, according to the latest insights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When those SMEs who haven't implemented anything new around <b>mental wellbeing</b> were asked why, the most common responses showed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">· 15% believe their employees don't need any <b>mental wellbeing</b> practices or support</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">· 14% have already put some of these practices in place</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">· 13% have never thought about implementing wellbeing practices or support for their employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amongst the businesses which had implemented new wellbeing initiatives in their workplaces, these practices included regular check-ins to manage workload (40%), introducing flexible hours to improve work/life balance (38%) and providing team members with a <b>mental health</b> day or days (32%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being mindful of employees' wellbeing and offering support around this is incredibly important to both workplace culture and performance. But putting in place measures to help empower conversations around wellbeing or improve workplace practices and support for employees, doesn't need to cost the earth," says <span class="companylink">MYOB</span>'s Felicity Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From growing their knowledge and inspiration around wellbeing at work using free resources available from MBIE, the <span class="companylink"><b>Mental Health</b> Foundation of <b>New Zealand</b></span> and Wellplace, to sharing free digital solutions created specifically for those in small business, like Smiling Mind, or establishing <b>mental health</b> "first aiders' in the workplace - there are a range of tools available to help small business owners and their teams."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to ongoing concerns about rural shortages of GPs, I presented, at the 2010 Health Informatics <b>New Zealand</b> Conference, on The Alaska Community Health Aide Programme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This programme utilises a community-based workforce, known as Community Health Aide Practitioners (CHAPs) trained to be the “eyes, ears and hands of physicians”, with the ability to work remotely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This provider model of care has been proven to address health care staffing shortages, and recruitment and retention of staff, in underserved areas in Alaska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When used with appropriate telehealth-based systems, studies have shown increased access to health care, decreased wait times, with overall improved effectiveness and cost savings throughout the health system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The headline Worn-out GP: System kaput, (<b>NZ</b> Herald, June 22) and Heather du Plessis-Allan’s column on Sunday both stress the need for more GPs and nurses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, true. However, after more than a decade, with little progress on that front, perhaps it is time to ask if there are other ways to solve the healthcare worker shortage? Don Lemieux, Te Kuiti.Getting toughThe oft-repeated “tough on crime” demand from some politicians is frequently focused on gangs as major suppliers of illegal substances. Significant factors in crime are poverty, poor mental, physical and social health, inadequate housing, insufficient education and substance dependency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So may we expect a crackdown on the liquor gangs, the fast-food gangs and the gambling gangs? These place multiple outlets among the poorest and most vulnerable communities nationwide and sponsor sport and recreation programmes to positively spin their products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These gangs also bring their most experienced lawyers to oppose council and community organisations struggling to deal with adverse effects saturation coverage of the products brings to vulnerable communities. They lobby parliamentarians relentlessly, often successfully, to avoid legislative changes that might hinder their outreach and expansion, their promotion and their profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These gangs seem unmoved by the nation’s epidemics of obesity or addiction, continually targeting the most vulnerable among us. By far the best way to deal with crime is to take all reasonable steps to empower a healthy, free, happy community and get tough on those organisations and industries legal or illegal that undermine this essential humanitarian purpose.John Marcon, Te Kauwhata.Proper facilitiesMore than 20 years of neglect of our mental institutions by respective governments has brought about the upsurge in mentally unwell currently creating concern in our communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The millions of taxpayer money the Government will undoubtedly waste on endless commissions of inquiry, lengthy commissions of inquiry reports, and the endless and costly meetings in the process when the solution is as plain as the noses on their faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the institutions, which, in ignorance, governments tore down, must be replaced, or in some cases renovated so these individuals can be kept off our streets, not five or 10 years hence but as of right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only then will <b>New Zealand</b> citizens feel safe as they go about their daily activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restoring the dysfunctional relationship that exists between our schools, <b>mental health</b> professionals and the police also would go a long way in resolving the problem.Gary Hollis, Mellons Bay.Winter illsThis current emergency department overload isn’t a new phenomenon, it is indeed an annual event. It is winter, and this increases those winter ailments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will never know whether strategies to manage a <b>Covid</b> surge came to pass. It seems that a surge did not eventuate, rather, lingered for the past two years it would seem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of us need to realise that doctors don’t cure us; they give expert advice and guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the patient who needs to heed that advice and use the tools that all health professionals have at their disposal to enable their patient to heal.John Ford, Taradale.Getting betterI heartily agree with C.G. Marnewick (<b>NZ</b> Herald, June 22) regarding disorderly wards in hospitals. It’s been going on for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years ago, my husband was in Auckland Hospital and the patient opposite had a continual flow of visitors all day and evening — with a noisy radio. Food was being passed around and unruly kids were throwing apple cores all over the place — they thought it was really funny. Patients are there to receive treatment and be able to rest and hopefully get better without these selfish patients and their visitors not respecting this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not having visited the hospital recently, I wonder if the “smokers” — patients in their pyjamas — are still by the front entrance, coughing and smoking in all weather. They should be sent home to enable room for a person who needs a bed and who would appreciate the space now available to them.P. Salvador, Hobsonville.MP silencedI was disappointed to read (<b>NZ</b> Herald, June 27) that Christopher Luxon silenced Simon O’Connor over his position on abortion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 51 conscience votes against the abortion law in March 2020. Surely those 51 MPs and future MPs have a right to express their opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do think it is a sad day for National when the leader can silence his team on issues he is not happy about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not about abortion, it is about the right of MPs to have an opinion and to have a conscience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout history, there have been thousands of members of parliament around the world who have regretted not exercising their conscience and speaking up for what they believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears there is no room for conscience in the National Party.David Hay, Lynfield.Child leadersLet’s give a huge shout-out to all the teachers who have worked so hard over many years to bring Matariki alive in early childhood centres and schools and to teach our youngest citizens about Matariki and what this time of year stands for from a Māori perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children have been learning about the values of aroha, manākitanga and kotahitanga and their parents and grandparents have been welcomed in to share kai and waiata at gatherings all over Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers have been generous with their time and energy and their work has allowed us to be ready as a nation to embrace and celebrate Matariki together on this, our special national day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are richer when we stand together.Chris Bayes, Torbay.Let peace reignThere have been two good responses to my letter (<b>NZ</b> Herald, June 21).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I agree that Russia is wrong to invade and continue this horrific war in Ukraine. The natural reaction to defend Ukraine with military power is understandable but not the solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nato must take some responsibility for triggering Russian roulette from war game to reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billions of US taxpayer dollars funding massive weaponry to defeat Russia only prolongs the war and could lead to a nuclear holocaust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is to stop this war and prevent future wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This requires dismantling the political, military-industrial complex and economic system that perpetuates warfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intelligent human beings would reject cultural indoctrination for wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine if governments funded peace education and non-violence training in Ukraine, Russia, the US and all nations, instead of violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine if <b>New Zealand</b> focused its support for Ukraine on humanitarian aid, and peacemaking services and refused to contribute to the techno-barbarism of modern warfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We resurrected Matariki culture – to be mainstream, honouring our Earth, heavens and all peoples. Now let’s truly help humanity end warfare by offering the best of our Aotearoa peace culture to the world.Laurie Ross, Glen Eden.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 5549 new community cases of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> in <b>New Zealand</b> yesterday and the Ministry of Health reported a further 11 <b>Covid</b>-related deaths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the deaths reported, two were people in their 60s, two in their 70s, three in their 80s and four over 90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two were from Auckland, one was from Waikato, one was from MidCentral, two were from Taranaki, one was from the Hutt Valley, three were from Canterbury and one was from South Canterbury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of reported deaths with <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> is now 1472.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 383 people in hospital with the virus, including six in intensive care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven-day rolling average for community case numbers today is 5132 — last Monday it was 4939.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The locations of yesterday’s community cases are in Northland (109), Auckland (1796), Waikato (298), Bay of Plenty (189), Lakes (69), Hawke’s Bay (190), MidCentral (144), Whanganui (72), Taranaki (150), Tairāwhiti (43), Wairarapa (52), Capital and Coast (537), Hutt Valley (224), Nelson Marlborough (192), Canterbury (934), South Canterbury (79), Southern (434) and the West Coast (35).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of active community cases in <b>New Zealand</b> is 35,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding cases in Auckland, the ministry said an error in Sunday’s reporting meant Counties Manukau and Waitematā case numbers were not added to the Auckland new cases total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New cases for Counties Manukau on Sunday were 386 and 657 for Waitematā. This meant the total new cases for Auckland on Sunday was 1452 (not 409).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Health Minister Andrew Little announced yesterday that the Government would be increasing access to free flu shots to 800,000 New Zealanders, including children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those eligible would be able to get free flu vaccines from Friday, July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will include children aged 3-12 and people with serious <b>mental health</b> or addiction needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little acknowledged noticing an increase in pre-schoolers hospitalised with influenza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re making free flu shots available to another 800,000 New Zealanders, including children, more of whom are having to go to hospital,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Free flu shots are already available for everyone over the age of 65 and those at risk of becoming seriously ill or who have underlying conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This season we ordered 40 per cent more vaccines. We’ve already seen more than one million New Zealanders get a flu shot, but with significant pressure on our health system we’re ramping up efforts to get as many people vaccinated as possible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comes as <b>Covid</b> vaccination rates, which have slowed to a trickle, are hoped to increase when medically vulnerable people become eligible for a second booster shot from tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the law was changed to allow people to access booster vaccinations without a prescription.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s hoped the extra level of protection will help protect those most at risk of severe illness — people who also could be hit hard by other respiratory infections that are sweeping the country over winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> Response Minister Ayesha Verrall said a second booster will be available for everyone over 50 and recommended for anyone over the age of 65 as well as Māori and Pacific peoples older than 50 and people who are severely immunocompromised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The availability of the second booster has also been extended to health, aged-care and disability workers over the age of 30,” Verrall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the combination of Omicron and flu was making this winter more challenging than normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The best thing New Zealanders can do to ensure they and their families don’t end up in hospital is to be up-to-date with their flu and <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> vaccinations and boosters.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federation of Primary Health Aotearoa (FPHANZ) says making flu shots available to more New Zealanders and the second <b>Covid</b> booster roll out are positive moves however is sounding a word of caution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From this Friday, around another 800,000 New Zealanders will be eligible for a free flu vaccine, and from tomorrow the Government is also rolling out a second <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> booster vaccine for older New Zealanders. Both will be available at GPs and pharmacies across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federation board member and Chair of General Practice <b>NZ</b>, Dr Jeff Lowe says he expects a challenging first few days however as people become vaccinated, particularly from the flu, there is likely to be a lessening of pressure on the health system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"GPs are still under a lot of pressure staffing wise and the number of patients we are seeing so this is going to be tough initially for everyone but we have got through some really difficult times over the last couple of years and I am sure we can do it again," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federation board member and Pharmacy Guild of <b>New Zealand</b> Chief Executive, Andrew Gaudin says "This is a routine activity for community pharmacies, and they remain ready, willing and able to fully support those needing this important service in our communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds, "The Guild supports the government move to widen access to free flu vaccines for children aged 3 to 12 and people with serious <b>mental health</b> and addiction needs, and a second <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> booster for those at risk of severe illness from <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>. This will help to keep New Zealanders healthy and well, and will reduce pressures on our hospitals, which are currently being stretched to their limits.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Director for the Suicide Prevention Office puts people at the heart of the mahi</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Health announced today that Matthew Tukaki (Ngāi Te Rangi) has been appointed as the new Director of the Suicide Prevention Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acting Deputy Director-General of <b>Mental Health</b> and Addiction, Dr Arran Culver, says that Matthew was particularly suited to heading up the Suicide Prevention Office as he was involved in establishing a similar model in <b>Australia</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that suicide can be prevented, but we need continued strong leadership and advocacy in this area and Matthew's skill and extensive experience will be of real benefit. While we have seen a small decrease in the number of suicides in the last two consecutive years of reporting, there is much more to do. Our goal is achieving a future where there is no suicide in Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>, and I know this is an aspiration close to Matthew's heart," Dr Culver says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Tukaki says he is excited about joining the Suicide Prevention Office and building on the mahi that has been underway since the Office was set up in 2019 .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Suicide prevention has been my passion for many years and here in Aotearoa I would like to believe we have an opportunity to really change the dial as we emerge from <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>. We know that many of the struggles of whānau and New Zealanders have been amplified as a result of the <b>pandemic</b>, but we also knew leading into it we had a lot of work to do," Mr Tukaki says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Tukaki starts in the role on 1 July and is looking forward to engaging with as many people and organisations as possible to make that meaningful difference from day one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It won't just take one or some of us - the mahi around suicide prevention in Aotearoa will take all of us - irrespective of our colour or creed, our postcodes or where we call home," says Mr Tukaki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On behalf of the Ministry of Health, Dr Culver would also like to acknowledge the outstanding work of Dr Sarah Hetrick, who stepped in and acted in the role while the search for a permanent appointment was underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Matthew Tukaki (Ngāi Te Rangi)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew is the former Chairman of <span class="companylink">Suicide Prevention <b>Australia</b></span> and was the inaugural Chair of the National Coalition for Suicide Prevention. Tukaki also developed the resource "How to have a Korero" and has been active in Indigenous suicide prevention for more than a decade. Tukaki was also involved in the establishment of the National Suicide Prevention Research fund and the national evaluation framework for suicide prevention programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the Suicide Prevention Office</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Suicide Prevention Office (SPO) was established in November 2019 to provide kaitiakitanga (leadership and stewardship) for suicide prevention efforts. A key focus of the Office is the ongoing implementation of the Suicide Prevention Action Plan 2019-2024 for Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>: He Tapu te Oranga and Budget 2019 suicide prevention and postvention initiatives of $40m over four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPO provides a central place for oversight and leadership of suicide prevention and postvention work across the country, supporting Māori leadership and working closely with communities, population groups experiencing high numbers or rates of suicide, and suicide prevention groups, organisations and agencies to achieve a future where there is no suicide in Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key achievements of the Suicide Prevention Office</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPO continues to make good progress implementing He Tapu te Oranga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Seven Suicide Prevention Community Funds targeted at Māori, Pacific, and Youth have been established since 2019</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Between February 2021 and March 2022, almost 4,500 people across Aotearoa received government funded LifeKeepers training and gained valuable suicide prevention skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Additionally, a range of other organisations, such as other government agencies, universities, and private businesses, have paid to have LifeKeepers training delivered to their staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Launched in September 2021, the Suicide Bereaved Response Service Aoake te Rā continues to grow, with 120 providers signed up and able to deliver services within all DHB areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Reviewing the coronial process for investigating suicide has begun. The result of the review will be recommendations about what changes could be made to improve the process. This is a cross-government collaborative process with representatives of bereaved families and whānau as well as Te Ao Māori and tikanga oversight. The review is expected to be completed by September 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• In response to a high-profile death and the ongoing lockdowns in Auckland in 2021, two social media campaigns (#chatsafe) reached over 400,000 young people and provided information about how to talk safely about suicide on social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• The family and whānau suicide prevention information service continues to improve information available to whānau. Four new resources are now available to ensure better support for those experiencing suicidal distress and those bereaved by suicide.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anewborn’s death could have been prevented if a pēpi-pod was delivered 24 hours earlier, a Coroner has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death has led to a recommendation that funding is considered to give all mothers of newborn babies one of the safe sleeping pods at birth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not the first time a coroner has recommended prioritising pēpi-pod use in infants, to stop parents from smothering their babies during co-sleeping, with as many as 12 recommendations dating back to 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coroners labelled the issue a “hidden epidemic” but a 2016 Weekend Herald investigation found a Ministry of Health contract to fund the bassinets was shelved, despite the death of about 50 babies a year from Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy [Sudi].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest tragedy, Eli Edwards-Te Rangi died in June last year in his mother’s bed, the night before her midwife was supposed to bring a pēpi-pod for the baby to sleep in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mother woke in the night to find her 4-week-old baby face down and unresponsive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coroner Alexander Ho recommended the Ministry of Health consider automatically issuing all newborns with a pēpi-pod or wahakura — a woven flax bassinet — at birth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is not sufficient that new parents are simply ‘offered’ such a device at birth,” Coroner Ho said in his ruling on Eli’s death. “Many new mothers are tired and overwhelmed after giving birth. They do not want to make another decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there is a serious public health desire to reduce deaths of babies from Sudi, simple steps that will prevent deaths should be taken before they are needed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deputy Chief Coroner Anne Tutton said it was concerning that coroners continued to investigate deaths that may be preventable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She endorsed the comments of former Chief Coroner, Judge Deborah Marshall, who said it was why coroners kept making the recommendations with the hope the message would get through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The evidence is quite clear of the dangers of co-sleeping without some protection for the baby,” Marshall said in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Babies are safest in a separate bassinet or cot, but if that was not possible, the pēpi-pod or wahakura was the ‘next best option’.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between September 2018 and June 2020, the number of Sudi-suspected deaths rose to 64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2020, the Ministry commissioned research culminating in three reports released last month, to understand the reasons behind the number of babies dying from Sudi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It found Māori babies were eight- and-a-half times more likely to die from Sudi than non-Māori.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The number of infants in <b>New Zealand</b> who die from Sudi each year is not declining and social inequities mean that the rate of Sudi is higher for babies who are Māori, or who live in areas of high deprivation,” the Ministry’s chief clinical adviser of child and youth health, Dr Tim Jellyman wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of baby Eli, the birthing unit offered his mum a pēpi-pod but she declined, saying she already had a bassinet at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coroner noted she was a smoker, and the midwife reminded her of the safe sleeping advice since her baby had been exposed to cigarette smoke during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coroner Ho said the mother declined an antenatal referral to smoke-free services, but he was sympathetic to her decision to co-sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Motherhood is exhausting. I appreciate the circumstances in which a sleep-deprived mother, frequently woken during the night to breastfeed, might choose to have a baby in bed with her instead of placing him back in the bassinet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b> College of Midwives chief executive Alison Eddy said pēpi-pods needed to be available for anyone who wanted one, not only those who smoked during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pre-term birth and low birth weight are also risk factors,” Eddy said. “Sudi is linked to health and social inequity and it is experienced more by those living in poverty.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing and poverty were among the issues identified in the Ministry of Health-commissioned reports released on May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other concerns were the need for engagement with whānau, smoking in pregnancy, infants who were sick and maternal <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Ministry of Health spokesperson told Open Justice any Sudi death was unacceptable, but stopped short on the question of funding pēpi-pods for all newborns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he said pēpi-pods could not be funded in <b>isolation</b> because they needed to be provided with appropriate safe sleep messaging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This included stop-smoking programmes, of which there were 16 funded throughout the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advice for safe sleeping continues to be avoiding all types of smoke, sleeping babies on their back, and on a flat surface with their faces clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breastfeeding newborns was found to create stronger immune systems.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Aucklanders paid big price for lockdowns: Hipkins</span>
</div><div class="author">Claire Trevett </div><div>568 words</div><div>27 June 2022</div><div>The New Zealand Herald</div><div>NZHLD</div><div>A010</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022 NZME Publishing Ltd. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> Response Minister Chris Hipkins says if the Government could redo the response, he would have scaled back the Auckland Delta lockdowns more quickly in the last three months of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what he would do differently on TVNZ’s Q+A yesterday, Hipkins said at the time decisions could only be made on the information at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were probably some areas we could have moved more quickly to step down some restrictions. That <b>lockdown</b> in Auckland at the end of 2021, I think nerves were pretty frayed by the end of that. And we should acknowledge that. Aucklanders paid a big price for our ongoing suppression of Delta while we got our vaccination rates up and so on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those lockdowns aimed to stop Delta making it out of Auckland as part of last-gasp efforts to hold the elimination strategy together — then to buy time to get vaccination levels up as it became obvious Omicron would arrive in <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It meant Aucklanders in <b>lockdown</b> from August 17 to December 2 — eased only by steps such as allowing people to meet and entertain visitors outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked why stricter measures were not still in place given Omicron was causing damage, Hipkins said the Government had to weigh up other factors such as the public tolerance for restrictions and their cost on the economy and to <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hipkins also pointed to the role public opinion had played — saying after public tolerance for measures ebbed there was little point keeping them in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was minister responsible for our border restrictions for two years and that was really tough going. By the end there is really no question we had started to run out of public support for maintaining border restrictions, so we really do have to respond to that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the end of the day our <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> response was only as successful as it was because New Zealanders were on board with it. If you start to lose the public, then the effectiveness of the response is going to diminish.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about vaccine mandates remaining in the health sector, Hipkins said that was now a decision for the health ministers. However, his view was that they were justified in health to keep vulnerable people safe. Asked why he should be moved out of the portfolio given Omicron was still circulating widely, Hipkins said it was now more a health response rather than involving multiple agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have moved well past the elimination strategy that we had for the better part of two years. We ... have to accept the reality that <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> is now here, it’s here to stay. We need to learn to do things differently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the country was “not out of the woods yet” but vaccines and medical treatments for <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> meant it was a different situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was proud of the overall management of the <b>pandemic</b>, saying it left <b>New Zealand</b> in much better shape than most other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six more people were reported yesterday to have died with <b>Covid</b>, and there are 4429 new community cases of the virus in <b>New Zealand</b>. There are also 332 people in hospital with the virus, seven in intensive care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 1461 people have now been publicly reported to have died with <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public comments by Key to Life founder Mike King draw scrutiny</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Health is seeking a “please explain” from the charitable trust behind youth counselling service Gumboot Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It follows comments made by former comedian and <b>mental health</b> advocate Mike King during an interview with broadcaster Sean Plunket on The Platform, a new media venture funded by the Wright family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King founded the Key to Life Charitable Trust, which fundraises for and runs Gumboot Friday, a service connecting young people under 25 with free counselling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his interview with Plunket this week, King discussed a $600,000 grant made by the ministry last year to Key to Life through a new <b>mental wellbeing</b> and innovation fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BusinessDesk has reported extensively on the circumstances surrounding the payment, which followed months of criticism levelled by King at the Government over its track record on <b>mental health</b> and at the ministry specifically for not funding Gumboot Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Jacinda [Ardern] announced last year that I was making too much noise. She announced she had $1.2million from her innovation fund which would help organisations like ours and Mates in Construction,” King told Plunket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry didn’t openly call for tenders for the fund, claiming it was exempt as a pilot funding mechanism (the service itself is not a pilot). Instead, it approached Key to Life and another organisation to apply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interview with Plunket, King said when the charity made its application, it did so on the basis that the money would be used to pay for counselling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the ministry told King the funds couldn’t be used for this purpose — because counsellors registered with the <b>New Zealand</b> Association of Counsellors aren’t regulated under a specific act — he said he asked for tips on reapplying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking with Plunket, he said the ministry told him: “Quote, ‘don’t worry about it, we’re just going to give you the money. You don’t even have to reapply’”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King went on to say the money hadn’t been touched and there were no requirements for what the trust could spend it on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The money is sitting in the bank untouched,” he said, adding later: “I don’t even have to tell them what I’m spending the money on. That’s a fact.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry confirmed that $300,000 was paid to Key to Life in September 2021. A further $300,000 was paid to the trust recently following a discussion with its chairman, Shane Webby, about how the first payment had been used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Arran Culver, acting deputy director-general for <b>mental health</b> and addiction at the ministry, said the ministry had since become aware of comments by King which might not be consistent with the funding agreement with Key to Life and previous commitments made by the trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are in the process of contacting the trust about the matter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry previously said the grant, while not available to pay for counselling, could be used for things like administrative support and platform innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King is no longer a current officer of the Key to Life trust but remains a spokesman. In a statement, he said he provided incorrect information during the interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rather than answer the question on the spot, I should have checked with the office to ensure I had the correct figures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first tranche of $300,000 had been used to develop essential research and analytics, King said, which would provide real-time measurement of project outcomes and counsellor resource allocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key to Life had yet to make a final decision on how to spend the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These funds will be used in accordance with Ministry of Health guidelines,” King said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry and Key to Life both defended the way the procurement was handled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to work with the ministry to ensure we maintain robust systems and protocols around the allocation of publicly provided funding,” Webby said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent Key to Life accounts filed with the charities register, for the year to March 31, 2021, showed the trust received $2,091,213 in donations, fundraising and other revenue, well down on the $2.8m recorded in the 2020 year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gumboot Friday-specific donations were recorded as $435,961, down from $1,414,650.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust paid $771,661 in counselling expenses in the 2021 year, about half its total expenses and well down on the $1,475,982 recorded the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust also had accumulated funds of $930,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Webby said fewer donations were made to Key to Life, which is the overarching organisation for Gumboot Friday and I Am Hope, in the year to March 31, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attributed this to the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All donations made to Gumboot Friday are in a separate bank account from donations made to the Key to Life Charitable Trust,” Webby said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All donations to Gumboot Friday were spent on counselling sessions, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2021, Key to Life funded a purpose-built online platform for Gumboot Friday which administers all donations and expenses as well as providing real-time reporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is unparalleled in <b>New Zealand</b> in the benefits it affords,” Webby said, adding access to counselling via Gumboot Friday was growing at about 230per cent and May 2022 was the biggest month ever.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Nearly half of Millennials and Generation Z members are living paycheque to...</span>
</div><div class="author">Cameron Smith </div><div>985 words</div><div>27 June 2022</div><div>The New Zealand Herald</div><div>NZHLD</div><div>A027</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022 NZME Publishing Ltd. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of Millennials and Generation Z members are living paycheque to paycheque, according to a recent survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey suggests that in many key areas, New Zealanders are feeling worse off than their counterparts in other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Deloitte</span> Global 2022 Gen Z &amp; Millennial Survey revealed the concerns of both generations in <b>New Zealand</b> and globally in a snapshot of more than 23,000 people in 46 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It found 41 per cent of Kiwi Gen Zers reported living paycheque to paycheque compared with 47 per cent of Millennials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, four in 10 Gen Z members and a third of Millennials in <b>New Zealand</b> said they worked a part-time or full-time side job to make ends meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to their biggest concerns, the cost of living ranked top for both generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of <b>New Zealand</b> Millennials (53 per cent) said the cost of living was their greatest concern, compared with 38 per cent of Gen Z.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the cost of living was also the biggest concern globally for both generations, only 36 per cent of millennials worldwide said this was the case, and 29 per cent of Gen Z.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not a great surprise that the cost of living came out as the top personal concern,” Deloitte <b>NZ</b> human capital partner Lauren Foster said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The reality facing Kiwi Gen Zs and Millennials is that house prices are averaging over $1 million, fuel prices are nearly three times the cost of other countries and many are needing to take on second jobs to help ease their financial pressures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the survey, <b>New Zealand</b> Gen Z members and Millennials feel less financially secure than the global trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked to strongly/tend to agree, 37 per cent of Kiwi Gen Zers and 43 per cent of Millennials said they feel financially secure, compared with 40 per cent and 46 per cent globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than half the <b>New Zealand</b> respondents — 42 per cent of Gen Z and 43 per cent of Millennials — felt confident they would be able to retire with financial comfort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future of workThe majority of Gen Zs (75 per cent) and Millennials (77 per cent) said they preferred hybrid work or working remotely. Both generations cited “helps me save money”, “positively impacts my <b>mental health</b>” and “frees up time to do other things that I care about” as the three biggest impacts of remote work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the survey found just 21 per cent of Kiwi Gen Z members would stay in their current job beyond five years (up from 18 per cent in 2021), while 40 per cent would leave within two years. Millennials were just as likely to leave their jobs beyond five years (27 per cent), while 29 per cent said they would leave within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pay was the biggest factor for both generations when it came to reasons for leaving their job, while having a good work/life balance was the top reason for choosing to work for a particular organisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, professor of human resource management at AUT Jarrod Haar told the Herald the Great Resignation “tidal wave” had hit <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Christian Yao, senior lecturer, human resource management at <span class="companylink">Victoria University of Wellington</span>, said hybrid working and the four-day work week were the future of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Apart from the historically low unemployment rate and increasingly high living costs, which drive people to rethink their jobs, another important factor behind the Great Resignation is that people are expressing dissatisfaction with the current working arrangements and the impact of work on their overall wellbeing,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The data shows that young generations of workers want jobs that give them better financial security, work/life balance and developmental opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I call this a “sustainable career” when healthy, long-term career goals can be maintained.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yao said organisations needed to rethink how they design work and engage with workers in a hybrid environment, and a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People who currently work in offices want the flexibility to work remotely, but those working in a hybrid mode also expressed dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Research shows that the lack of physical contact with others due to remote work can stifle efforts to remain engaged and consequently impede career development and progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Physical <b>isolation</b> from the workplace has been linked to feelings of loneliness, role conflict, and longer hours overall for remote workers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yao said the <b>pandemic</b> had made businesses change work arrangements at a speed not seen before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many companies made passive changes using ‘not fit for purpose’ technologies,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Zoom meetings and online collaboration were brought in to replace traditional work methods. However, businesses do not necessarily understand or have the time to investigate whether these new approaches fit their strategic goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What you end up with is old wine in a new bottle. It won’t work, and indeed it will not be sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is an opportunity to rethink work arrangements, improve efficiency and leave more time for workers to focus on personal commitments and interests.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High stressThe survey revealed stress and burnout levels are high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of Gen Z (51 per cent) felt stressed all or most of the time, up 6 points from last year’s survey, and higher than the global rate of 46 per cent, while 42 per cent of Millennials said they felt stressed all or most of the time, up 2 points and higher than the global 38 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These statistics were set amongst underlying fear of not being financially stable in the future, worries about their day-to-day finance and burnout from workload pressure,” Foster said. Almost half of Gen Z (42 per cent) and Millennials (46 per cent) reported having taken time off work because of stress or anxiety.</p>

</div><div class="author"><b>New Zealand</b> Government </div><div>657 words</div><div>27 June 2022</div><div>07:25</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government has widened access to free flu vaccines with an extra 800,000 New Zealanders eligible from this Friday, July 1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children aged 3-12 years and people with serious <b>mental health</b> or addiction needs now eligible for free flu dose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From tomorrow (Tuesday), second <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> booster available six months after the first booster for older New Zealanders and other groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government is ramping up access to free flu vaccines and <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> booster shots for those groups of people who are being admitted in increasing numbers to hospital, Health Minister Andrew Little announced today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're making free flu shots available to another 800,000 New Zealanders, including children, more of whom are having to go to hospital," Andrew Little said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Free flu shots are already available for everyone over the age of 65 and those at risk of becoming seriously ill or who have underlying conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This season we ordered 40 per cent more vaccines. We've already seen more than one million New Zealanders get a flu shot, but with significant pressure on our health system we're ramping up efforts to get as many people vaccinated as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In recent weeks we have seen a number of pre-school children hospitalised with the flu. We also know children can be transmitters of the flu to others in their family who are more at risk, so it makes sense to reduce transmission as much as we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also know that people with serious <b>mental health</b> or addiction needs can get seriously sick from the flu, which is why we're also extending flu vaccinations to this group this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The extension of the free flu vaccination to more at-risk New Zealanders is just one of the actions we are taking to reduce pressure on our health system this winter," Andrew Little said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said a second <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> booster was available for everyone over the age of 50 and recommended for anyone over the age of 65, as well as Māori and Pacific peoples older than 50 and people who are severely immunocompromised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The availability of the second booster has also been extended to health, aged-care and disability workers over the age of 30," Dr Verrall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For those not at risk of severe illness from <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>, a two-dose primary course and one booster continues to provide very good protection. So, for those who haven't had a first booster, please act now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second booster dose should be offered six months after the previous dose, and postponed for three months after a <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> infection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second booster dose is not recommended for anyone who is pregnant and is healthy, including those with no underlying health conditions which could increase the risk of severe <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Staying up-to-date with the recommended <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> vaccinations will continue to protect you from the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation or death," Dr Verrall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Ministry of Health's <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> Vaccine Technical Advisory Group will continue to review new information on <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> and vaccines and will make further recommendations on eligibility criteria as necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The combination of Omicron and flu is making this winter more challenging than normal. The best thing New Zealanders can do to ensure they and their families don't end up in hospital is to be up-to-date with their flu and <b>COVID</b><b>-19</b> vaccinations and boosters," Dr Verrall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who is eligible for a second booster can get one without a prescription from a range of places, including walk-in and drive-through vaccination centres, booking online using BookMyVaccine or by calling the <b>COVID</b> Vaccination Healthline on 0800 282926. Flu shots are available by booking with GPs or local pharmacies.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Time for a mid- year stocktake?</span>
</div><div>1315 words</div><div>26 June 2022</div><div>The New Zealand Herald</div><div>NZHLD</div><div>A036</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022 NZME Publishing Ltd. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday marks the middle of the year, so is it time to do a stocktake of your life, asks Paul Little</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year is half over. Or half begun, depending where you fall on the optimism/pessimism scale. Give yourself a pat on the back for getting this far. As we know from 2020 and 2021, things could be a lot worse. But let’s not overdo the patting because they could also be a lot better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you made some New Year’s resolutions and promptly forgot where you put them, now is a good time to reconsider your options. The middle of the year a good date to stop and think about how far we have come, and where we are going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First the good news: You’re alive, your job still exists, and you’re still with your partner or happily single. But maybe your health could be better, your job could be more fulfilling and things could be improved on the relationship front. Maybe now is the time for a re-set. How do you even know whether we need to?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think some people are hardwired to know what’s good for them. And to know how to do it. Others need a bit of a nudge, says psychologist Sara Chatwin of mindworks.co.<b>nz</b>. “They need to have the self-insight to go: I’m not really on this.’ Some people wind up at this point going, ‘Whoa, I wanted to do this, but what have I actually done?’ ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-insight isn’t genetic. Where does the person who needs it find it? “I often tell my clients to just sit and think about how their life has played out. So if the same things have happened to them over and over again, the lessons aren’t being learned. Sometimes friends and family members can identify that things are going wrong.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chatwin’s advice for any resolution echoes that of most experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It helps to set short-term goals that are small, tangible and attainable. A huge goal can be scary.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quick example of making a small, tangible and attainable goal: if you want to read more, aim to set aside one evening a week for reading. Don’t tell yourself you’re going to read a book a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chatwin also recommends a psychological spring clean: “In our heads there can be so much rubbish stored up from decades ago that we actually need to let go of. So the psychological spring clean is the ability to go, ‘Oh, boy, I need to get over this or I need to stop thinking about this negativity’.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A professional or even a good buddy — who is less likely to be bound up in the dynamic than a family member — can help with this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you’ve decided to do your mid-year stocktake, it’s time to focus on your resolutions. It’s no good having a great job, learning to save or reintroducing bliss to your marriage if you aren’t well enough to enjoy them. As earth-shaking as the <b>pandemic</b> has been, the general advice around health is pretty much the same as it has been for decades: don’t smoke, exercise regularly and eat sensibly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GP Bryan Betty, medical director of the Royal <b>New Zealand</b> College of General Practitioners, says it’s never too late to lift our health game and that a few lifestyle changes can make a lot of difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just increasing the amount that you walk per day has an incredible effect on overall health, cardiovascular health and blood pressure,” says Betty. “Exercise is probably better than any medication we could possibly throw at someone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual — or midyear — check-up is also advised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can then start to look at things that are hidden, like our cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Knowing about these things early prevents problems 10 to 20 years later.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GP is also a good first responder to <b>mental health</b> concerns: “GPs are very skilled at <b>mental health</b> issues, and they’ve got certain approaches to them. The bulk of what happens with <b>mental health</b> is done in the general practice setting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Betty warns against setting ourselves up to fail by making overly ambitious resolutions: “If you say, ‘I’m going to go to the gym every day for two hours and work out,’ you will fail. Instead, do something very simple that is achievable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After mental and physical wellbeing, the next priority for many people is financial health, which is closely linked to career satisfaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making resolutions in the areas of careers and finance, and then revisiting our goals regularly is highly recommended by Vanessa Pope, a financial adviser with The Private Office. She recommends starting with the free money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The key thing is KiwiSaver,” she says. “If you contribute, the minimum amount, of $1,042.86 you’ll get half of that. So you get $521.43.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year’s Big Question is “to buy or not to buy” — a house, that is. Individual circumstances differ widely but, says Pope: “If you can get on the ladder when you’re in your 20s, it’s not a chain around your neck, because you can easily rent it out and still enjoy your life.” In other words — someone else can pay your mortgage while you live elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any financial strategy requires some self-control. People should budget and probably don’t do it enough, but “it’s just managing the basics. List your expenses and what you earn. Once it’s written down, you can see where you can make the cutbacks if you want to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you want to change jobs, as most people do at some stage, how do you make that call? The career that makes you happiest might not be the most financially rewarding, and the high-paying jobs make a lot of people miserable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pope says some people prefer satisfaction, some want the money. Although her work is in finance, her approach is not just about being shown the money: “You spend so many hours [at work] it’s important to enjoy it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, you can be fit as a fiddle, loving your job and as miserable at hell at home. There’s nothing like being emotionally unsatisfied to take the shine off your newly improved life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve had a lot of clients come in to do a midlife review since <b>Covid</b>,” says relationship coach and therapist Ann Jay. “When you have to slow down, you take stock. The standard line is, ‘We’ve been having some struggles,’ or ‘Things have not been going well, for a couple of years.’ ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are cases where people shouldn’t have waited until it was broken to fix it. Some are cases where it doesn’t even need fixing, just a little light dusting. Or a couple may have made a New Year’s resolution that hasn’t stuck. They mistake the resolution for the execution. To avoid that, says Jay, they have to be “very intentional”, which means committing to a goal, even if it’s something as simple as not using their phones during dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says there are a couple of key things that will help with emotional and relationship wellbeing: One is prioritising it. “We need to keep nurturing our relationship. And even if we’ve got kids, we need to put the relationship at the top of the pyramid, because if you’ve got that right, then everything else will flow from that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another is accentuating the positive: “Talk about what’s going well between you, about hopes and dreams for the future, because that keeps us motivated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And without motivation, nothing else will happen, no matter what time of year you’ve chosen to take stock.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Navigating pregnancy and childbirth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">can be a minefield for many Kiwis, but</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">for those in Aotearoa’s queer, Takatāpui, community that journey can be even more fraught. Katie Harris speaks to</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a trans man and his partner about</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">their road to parenthood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frankie and Rāwā fell in love during the <b>pandemic</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it was because of our shared interest in being human-rights defenders that we really bonded over that from the get-go,” Rāwā (Waitaha, Kāti Māmoe, Kāi Tahu) shares about his partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While their first meet-up was over coffee, the pair ended up working at the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> disability response together and began dating once they left their roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the queer-identifying couple, who live in Canterbury with their dog Māui, are planning on expanding their whānau. And Frankie, who is a non-binary trans gay man, will be carrying their child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are plenty of trans people like me who have children and they do it in the shadows because of the social stigma around it, and for safety reasons, and lots of really valid reasons.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, they say it means there isn’t much visibility of their experience. “People look at us and we’ll say we’re starting a family and often the next question is, ‘Oh who’s the surrogate.”’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frankie stopped taking testosterone in October 2020, and in 2021 the couple wed and got the green light to start trying for a baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, the couple have already gone through two miscarriages, which occurred in the first trimester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Certainly the second time around, we’d got quite a bit further than the first time so we were starting to feel okay to dream and imagine,” Frankie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are trying to conceive as naturally as possible, in a very similar way that cis heterosexual couples would. For example, they haven’t needed a surrogate or egg donor to become pregnant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rāwā, who is bisexual and attracted to masculinity regardless of gender, feels honoured to be undertaking this together, but also protective of Frankie, wanting others to respect that it’s Frankie’s journey and Frankie’s body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Media in the past, around pregnant dads especially, or pregnant men, has been over-scandalised ... Which we are particularly mindful about, and have seen that happen within <b>New Zealand</b> media as well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he’s cautious, only speaking where they feel safe to do so, yet understanding the positive power of publicising what is often kept private. The couple are currently filming a documentary about the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of sharing their kōrero, each day feels different for Frankie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some days you’ve got more energy to sort of educate and talk to people about things and other days it would be easier if people just knew and knew about how these things work and I wasn’t doing that sort of emotional labour to educate them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, they say it’s okay because they explain Frankie can carry the child themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They either get it because they have some level of understanding or they kind of just like, eyebrows shoot through the roof, like how is that possible?” Frankie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a fertility provider, which was engaged to test both Frankie and Rāwā’s fertility, they have faced issues, with Frankie being misgendered on clinic forms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Who can we go to who’s trusted, who will look after us in a way that will respect us as a couple, respect Frankie as they identify and understand the nuance that comes with being part of the queer community,” Rāwā wonders aloud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides that incident, which left Frankie in tears, they say their experience with that provider was “fantastic”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They told the Herald the face-to-face consultation they had with the specialist was very respectful and he was “very focused” on making sure they didn’t feel dysphoric during the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He said to me, immediately, if you aren’t comfortable with an internal ultrasound we don’t have to do that and there are other ways we can get the information we’re looking for. So I felt like it was very positive and respectful,” Frankie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through this the couple learned they were “exceptionally fertile” but there were certain elements of their physiology they needed to look at in order to conceive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For Frankie, it’s coming off testosterone and getting thyroid levels right for that early stage of pregnancy, which will minimise our risk for future miscarriages,” Rāwā says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alongside the emotions of trying to conceive, as well as miscarrying, the couple are navigating a challenging space which is perceived as inherently female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>’s Health Ministry told the Herald on Sunday data surrounding how many men were conceiving was not collected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main barriers for trans men being seen, Frankie says, is the overtly heteronormative and cis-normative materials provided to hopeful parents in fertility spaces, even though many queer people use these services too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Then you go to the hospital and if you go to the women’s clinic, it’s the women’s clinic, and you’re sitting there and if you don’t have a chick with you that day you get a lot of weird looks. [This] only happened to me once so far but we know eventually down the track that discomfort will arise again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key area Rāwā says could positively change this space is the language used surrounding pregnant people. “Simple things like gestational parent, or pregnant people, are a very easy way for us to change the language and it’s something we can do immediately.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the greatest change, he says, is trying to alter people’s views, which would require a culture shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m hoping that our story will help with that culture shift, in a way that it helps elevate people’s real-life experience in this space.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking publicly isn’t without risks, as transphobia, biphobia and homophobia are rife on some online platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The immediate fear is our profile goes up as a result and people start attacking us in social media spaces and our <b>mental health</b> is [harmed] as a result,” Rāwā says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is our family we’re wanting to start and our lives and it’s not really impacting anyone else. It’s just us and our family and we’re wanting to start a family and this is what family looks like for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well as this, the couple are mindful of how their public journey could impact their child in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rāwā sees this as a lifelong decision they’re making, and one that will hopefully improve society, but also one that might be “thrown in” their faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a reason we are telling the story and that is to show and help people understand what it’s like for trans people to go through a pregnancy, and then there’s another element of encouraging trans people to be brave enough to join us on that journey if they want to, or feel safe enough to have these conversations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Frankie says pregnancy and childbirth is a choice not all trans men, or even cis women, want to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, they say, many people assume trans people either don’t want or can’t have children, which is not the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Certainly for me, I knew I was trans really young as a kid and I also knew very young that I wanted to have children and carry them myself.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They see this as a kind of lifelong battle, trying to reconcile their desire for children, with that process also being seen as inherently female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By sharing their journey, they’re trying to break that down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s quite a normal way for people to have a family and so I think we were really keen to talk about it, because in talking about it some of our friends who never thought this would be possible for them have actually started going down this track as well.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the depressed, faceless parents who feel as if their children have died. Lost in a Family Court system that doesn't have the ability to act quickly, their situation has been made worse by the <b>pandemic</b>. Nadine Porter investigates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--------------------</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a note that should have sent a chill through Family Court judges and the lawyers who represent separated parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The note encompassed *Sam's last thoughts, and the sense of hopelessness he felt about a system that enabled children to become estranged from a parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fix the Family Court," Sam wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly overwhelmed by a court system that could suspend access to his 4-year-old son without any evidence that it was required, Sam died by suicide, in his Auckland sleep-out, some time in the first two days of June 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A talented apprentice builder, the 25-year-old adored his son but had been put through years of protracted court processes due to the nature of Without Notice Applications (WNA) and lengthy delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under such an application a parent can apply for an urgent court order that suspends previous custody arrangements in an emergency situation. It is an important tool when abuse of a child is alleged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's the time taken to deal with the notices if the alleged abuse is unfounded that is costing innocent parents time with their children and can lead to intractable estrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Sam's son was six months old, his former partner made a similar application, claiming he physically hurt his son. For three months Sam had to live without seeing his son, until an investigation cleared him of the allegations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he held no animosity towards the mother, who had mistakenly believed minor injuries were signs of abuse, instead of a playing accident with the child's aunty, it took a huge toll, both on his relationship with his son, and financially, as he tried to navigate the Family Court process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over three years later, and after many custody debates, Sam found himself on the end of another WNA for domestic abuse of his son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instantly, he was suspended from seeing him every weekend, in what had become part of Sam's and his extended family's life. Completely lost without that family time, he couldn't understand what was happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just eight days before, Oranga Tamariki (OT) had notified him that his son had told a kindergarten supervisor that his father hit and swore at him. Sam did not know why his son had said what he did and was blindsided by the investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, 10 days later, OT advised Sam that the allegation of abuse was not substantiated, and contact arrangements could resume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day later Sam's ex-partner and her lawyer filed a WNA, meaning he could not see his son until a Family Court hearing took place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already in $20,000 credit card debt to deal with ongoing legal fees, Sam's <b>mental health</b> was deteriorating. He began to switch off. He couldn't see a way out and didn't know, but feared, what the extended estrangement would do to his son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks later, Sam would take his own life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam's parents can't understand why his ex-partner's lawyer did not do due diligence before filing the application. If she had done so, she would have discovered that OT's investigation had cleared Sam of the allegations a day before the interim variation custody order was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am still livid about the lawyer and her approach and the fact that she did not do her duty," his father, Terry, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially he tried to suppress his anger, but now he and Sam's family want to push for change in the Family Court system to ensure the same tragedy does not happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nothing will bring Sam back," his mum, Amy, says of her choice to speak out. "But other parents going through this will know they are not alone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sister Talia stressed that Sam made it clear the situation wasn't his ex-partner's fault, but rather a product of the Family Court system. "She utilised the system that was put in place for her," Talia said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a death</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam's story is familiar to other parents who feel the Family Court system sometimes protects and encourages some parents to actively pursue orders that could cause intractable estrangement between a child and a parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are some deliberate cases where custodial parents restrict a child's access to a parent, it's important to note that the Family Court plays a vital role in protecting children from a violent or abusive parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can be a fine line understanding if a child genuinely doesn't want to be with a parent because they have experienced harm, or if there is a parent using the system for their own emotional means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, an abusive parent has claimed their children's reluctance to see them was due to the other parent deliberately turning the children against them, a practice dubbed parental alienation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's not disputed that it's necessary to protect a child should there be an allegation made against a parent, lengthy and costly court-hearing delays can further estrange a rejected parent if the allegation is found to be false.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take *Lilly and *Jono's situation, with a history of 13 years in and out of the Family Court to try to keep Jono's now 14-year-old daughter, Carrie, in their family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially Carrie was in a 50/50 custody arrangement between her parents and seemed to be happy with the arrangement. But very quickly, Carrie's mother began to file WNAs, claiming her daughter had been abused at the hands of stepmother Lilly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Carrie was 7, and again when she was 9, the mother was forced to withdraw abuse allegations against Lilly after Carrie unequivocally denied it had happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Carrie was 11, her mother began her eighth application to return full custody to her. This time she cited the same allegations against Lilly that she had claimed previously, with a letter written by Carrie to back it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilly and Jono were devastated, and have now not seen Carrie for three years as they continue to wait for a court hearing. They believe Carrie was coerced by her mother to write the allegations and think a child psychologist would have helped to prove that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal expenses and child support have now left the couple $350,000 out of pocket, and they have no idea if they'll ever be able to reforge their relationship with Carrie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three years apart from Carrie, with zero communication, the couple have agreed that the next court hearing will be their last. Jono feels the system and the time it takes for a hearing to take place is forcing him to walk away from his daughter permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Lilly, claims that Jono has effectively abandoned his daughter are simply not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He jumped over barrier after barrier until he can't jump any more and people say he walked away? No, he didn't walk away. He was pushed out of her life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process has broken Jono, and Lilly fears what would have happened had he not had strong family support and the couple's three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it hasn't happened to you, you cannot understand the severity of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Effectively the couple believe they have lost a child, but the grief is ambiguous because Carrie is still here. On top of that they suffer the pain that Carrie's rejection brings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like a death. No, she's not dead, but she's completely lost to us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilly feels it all could have been prevented if the Family Court had intervened sooner and ordered a psychological evaluation of Carrie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile the couple's grief continues, as does that of the extended family, who have also been excluded from Carrie's life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are the concerns about the impact on Carrie, with a grandparent telling the couple that their daughter was now deeply troubled and shut herself in her bedroom every day. She had also experienced suicidal thoughts and was depressed and anxious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most difficult cases to deal with</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 30 years former Family Court judge Dale Clarkson has dealt with what the profession then termed "intractable access cases" - when contact with a non- custodial parent couldn't be accomplished. Today the cases are termed "resist and refuse".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clarkson believes these types of cases have become longer and more complex. They were always understood to be among the hardest to deal with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relationships and long- term implications that were at stake ensured she always spent extra time thoroughly assessing cases at the beginning, believing it would help speed the process up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Spending a bit more time at the front end saved enormous time for the court in the long run and more importantly stems the pain the parents and a child are going through."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having one judge dealing with a family right through the system was important, and it was crucial that complex cases were dealt with as quickly as possible, to limit the amount of time a child might be separated from a parent, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know that everyone is aware of just how crucial it is to manage these cases and push them through."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clarkson has seen both genders cause issues, saying one of the hardest cases she dealt with was a difficult father who was undermining the mother's custodial relationship with their child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And I didn't have any leverage because he wasn't the custodial parent . . . It was almost impossible to deal with."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using psychologists early in the process can help a parent who feels wounded from a separation, and stop them using a child as a means of emotional survival. It can also help a judge make decisions, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Empathetic to those parents caught up in a financial nightmare from Family Court costs, Clarkson believes a new legal aid category might help for the most complex intractable cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's horrendous - legal aid has been so restrictive in recent years, and it has exacerbated the whole thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clarkson and her husband, Hugh, have previously researched the subject of parental alienation and presented two papers on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of them they choose to use the term "post-separation parental rejection" in order to shift the debate from being about a parent's behaviour to the problem of a child's rejection of a parent. It also connects the rejection of the parent to the parents' separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple found that in a situation where the child's rejection of the parent is out of proportion to the perceived failings of that parent, the causes and solutions to the issue are complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They suggest that where the rejected parent has not been abusive, and where the relationship was good before the separation, the child's relationship with the aligned parent must be examined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, <b>New Zealand</b> has only a small number of child psychologists, Clarkson says, and they are often booked up for months ahead. Getting to the heart of the issue can be problematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a handful of extreme cases where an aligned parent has been proven to be deliberately harming a child's relationship with the rejected parent, Clarkson has reversed custody arrangements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it sometimes seemed punitive and harsh on children, Clarkson found that it had been relatively successful once therapy and mediation changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was the only thing that changed the dynamic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zayne Jouma deals with alienated parents in their darkest moments and believes the problems are escalating because of the slowness of the Family Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a founder of Family Dispute Support Services, Jouma knows most parents who have been estranged from their children end up abandoning them altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They find it is an easier fix than dealing with the Family Court process but find living with the grief and loss of a child is the hardest to deal with."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a father who went through the same issue with his daughter, Jouma went down a "very dark pathway" before he got a resolution, describing it as the worst experience he's had in his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suicide, self-harm and job loss are the all-too-frequent results of Family Court processes, according to Jouma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, a father waiting for a Family Court hearing after a WNA suspended his ability to see his son, saying he had received a warning from his employer because he could no longer focus at work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The father expected to lose his job because he couldn't stop thinking about his child every moment of the day, or how he was going to pay for a lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many parents Jouma deals with are financially broke, unable to fund a lawyer, and the majority have no comprehension of the court process or how they can help their case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jouma puts the blame squarely on the Family Court, because the court system is adversarial, in that a judge must decide on a winner and a loser. "It doesn't work that both parents win."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add delays into the system, with some parents seeking advice from Jouma after three years of supervised contact, and the risk of permanent estrangement to a rejected parent increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not just a <b>New Zealand</b> issue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a seminal moment in Britain's House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I speak as an objective onlooker moved by stories of injustice, hopelessness and deep sorrow," an MP who would later become the attorney-general proclaimed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was 2017 when Suella Braverman denounced Family Courts for the role they were playing in estranging parents from children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braverman was concerned at the inability of courts to make a defaulting parent comply with a child arrangement order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The courts are slow to respond and reluctant to penalise, sending the damaging messages that court orders are optional, not mandatory, that the relationship with the non- resident parent is meaningless, rather than crucial."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the worst cases, a non- custodial parent could be denied contact with their child for several years, she went on to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they do not have a spare [PndStlg]10,000 to spend on legal fees, they are essentially erased out of their child's life with no remedy whatsoever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braverman's rallying cry acknowledged the festering sore that had been clogging the British Court system - and fuelled the rising number of parents whose relationships with children had been completely severed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later a survey by Good Egg Safety, and shared via <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, asked about parental estrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 1500 UK residents who had been impacted by estrangement shared their experiences; 56% male and 43% female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those who responded, 40% said they had not had face-to-face time with their children for more than a year and 11% said they had not spent any direct time with their child in more than five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, 80% reported they had suffered an adverse health impact, while 16% said they felt suicidal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of the respondents said they had also been impacted financially through repeated court processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One English father summed up his experience as eight years of struggle, 29 court hearings and more than [PndStlg]150,000 in fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A father in Northern Ireland said he nearly took his own life. "My wife came and stopped me. I was severely depressed, I can't believe what I was thinking. I have two younger kids with my wife, and it would have ruined their lives too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study reported that children who have been unfairly estranged from one of their parents after separation could suffer long-term effects and concluded that early intervention was essential to ensure children were quickly reunited with the rejected parent - something that was rarely addressed under the UK's current system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rehabilitation gives hope to estranged parents</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to an American study in 2019, a quarter of children of separated or divorced parents experienced moderate to severe estrangement from one of them - the equivalent of about 3.8 million children across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on those children has been likened to a form of child abuse, with another American study in 2019 showing the long- term consequences include anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, emotional dysregulation, identity development disruption, substance abuse and poor peer and romantic relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Externally behaviours such as ADHD, oppositional defiance disorder, and negative academic and occupational impacts were also observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An international authority and consultant to parents and attorneys on divorce and a child's rejection of a parent, Dr Richard A Warshak, has written a book on the issue, Divorce Poison: How to Protect Your Family from Bad-mouthing and Brainwashing, and helped found a programme to help parents reunite with their estranged children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This North American programme, called Family Bridges, is currently used in six countries, including <b>Australia</b>, and Dale Clarkson believes it could be effective here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developed in 1991, it was first used to assist in reuniting recovered missing children with their parents but was quickly extended to non-abducted children who were unreasonably estranged from a parent during the divorce process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often severely estranged children will arrive at the workshop anxious, angry, confused and reluctant to spend any time with the estranged parent. By the end, about three-quarters of the children participating have successfully reconnected with the parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The workshop aims include facilitating, repairing and strengthening children's ability to maintain healthy relationships with both parents, as well as strengthening their critical thinking and helping them maintain balanced views and a more realistic perspective of both parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its success has seen the American Family Court system use it as a tool to help the most severe cases of estrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for those parents unable to use the workshop, Warshak gives hope. Hang in there, he says. Patience pays off. "One of the major takeaways from the Family Bridge workshop is that the situation is not hopeless."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand rises to</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">unprecedented</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">levels as DHBs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">struggle to fill</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">gaps in skilled</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">staff numbers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when more children and teenagers have <b>mental health</b> problems, the specialist services that treat the most severe conditions are more stretched than ever, and some are reaching “crisis point”, a Weekend Herald investigation has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health officials, clinicians and parents say child and adolescent <b>mental health</b> services run by district health boards in <b>New Zealand</b> — which collectively saw about 51,000 patients last year, including some of the most vulnerable young — have been overwhelmed by unprecedented demand and a workforce crunch years in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviews with people in the sector and documents obtained from health authorities reveal the problems in these services are more extensive and urgent than have previously been reported. They show while demand surged in the past few years, services across the country have struggled to provide an adequate level of care, putting patients at risk and causing staff to burn out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Child and adolescent services, known in the sector as “CAMHS” or “ICAMHS”, were already facing a rising tide of young people with depression, anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders and other serious conditions before the <b>pandemic</b>, and <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> amplified the trend, clinicians, researchers and officials say. But after decades of underfunding and understaffing, the services are poorly equipped to respond to the growing need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DHBs have been scrambling to recruit psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and other skilled staff — often with little success. In some places, clinicians’ caseloads reached twice the level considered safe. Inexperienced workers have been thrust into highly stressful and risky positions because no other staff were available. Many have left the sector, frustrated and exhausted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Struggling to cope with the demand, services have increased their thresholds for admission, meaning some young people with significant <b>mental health</b> problems have been turned away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those accepted face growing waits for assessments and therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Capital &amp; Coast DHB, based in Wellington, the clinical leader of the young persons’ <b>mental health</b> services sent a memo to her bosses in January setting out “grave concerns” about the psychiatrist workforce across the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is currently absolutely no ‘fat’ in our CAMHS [senior medical officer] staffing,” she wrote. “None at all.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resignations and retirements had left the service so short of psychiatrists that if one took a holiday there would be nobody to cover them. “This situation puts the services and the doctors at risk,” the clinical leader wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancies for nurses and allied health professionals across CAMHS were at “historic highs, at the same time that referrals have increased massively in the past year”, she added. “Experienced clinicians have been resigning at alarming rates.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DHB would recruit replacements, but “it is very likely that many of these will have little CAMHS experience”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Capital &amp; Coast developed a business case to outsource therapy for patients with “moderate” <b>mental health</b> conditions to a charity, in an attempt to “blitz” its waitlist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is well known that there has been a national surge in demand for CAMHS in response to the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b>,” the business case stated. “This has coincided with a shortage of suitably qualified and experienced clinicians, with additional challenges recruiting with closed borders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the Wellington CAMHS service was missing half of its staff, the business case said, and about a quarter of the 129 young people seeking face-to-face contact had been waiting more than six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A specialist team for young Māori was in an even worse state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The service has had a significant number of resignations over the last 12 months,” the document said, and “this coupled with the surge in referrals during the <b>Covid pandemic</b> has meant we have been unable to meet the needs of young people referred to the service ... Many young people and whānau have protracted wait times with no intervention unless they present in crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The increased wait has at times culminated in a deterioration of the <b>mental health</b> of these young people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an eight-page memo to their leadership just before Christmas, employees in the Māori team warned that the division was in a “crisis state” because of the staffing problems. They had “significant concerns” about the safety of patients who were not being seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is no transparency with the public on the challenges faced by our (and other) services they are going on referral lists for,” the staff said, “thus we are not enabling them to make informed choices on their health care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karla Bergquist, executive director of <b>mental health</b> services at Capital &amp; Coast, told the Weekend Herald the Wellington team had hired several new staff and reduced its waiting list to 94 in June, although “we accept that the waitlist remains high and acknowledge the distress this could cause to young people and their families”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Māori team is actively recruiting for permanent roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The service works continually to ensure current models, resource, and capacity are aligned with the needs of the rangitahi we provide care for,” Bergquist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Lakes DHB, in Rotorua, the manager of the <b>mental health</b> service told executives in a memo in September: “The ICAMHS workforce gap has reached a crisis point and with an increase in demand and complexity this is now a significant clinical risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lakes is funded to provide <b>mental health</b> care to 3 per cent of young people in the region, but at the time it was seeing twice that, the memo said. Staffing pressures meant “demand can no longer be met”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the same manager gave a presentation to a public oversight committee which said Lakes’ ICAMHS service was on the DHB’s register of major risks listed as “critical” and was unable to “fully deliver the contracted service due to critical staff shortages and there is a risk of further staff leaving due to burnout and less stressful opportunities”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Lakes said it had since recruited a senior nurse to the service and was bringing on other staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All ICAMHS across the country are under pressure, some of which is due to <b>isolation</b> and social changes due to <b>Covid</b>,” a spokesperson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have made changes to how the service is delivered to try and manage the increasing demand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At MidCentral, in Palmerston North, a manager said in a memo in September that clinicians were “working at or above capacity”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Whanganui DHB, a manager warned in November young people were waiting an average of three months to see a psychiatrist, “the longest it has ever been, although not exceptional nationally”. The DHB said in a statement the average wait was now two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canterbury, the DHB’s young persons’ service is listed as a “major” concern on its risk register, because of capacity constraints causing “unacceptably high” waiting times for assessments and treatments and increasing the likelihood of young people suffering harm and staff burning out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Hawke’s Bay, concerns about the regional service there prompted the DHB to commission an external review last year. DHB officials refused to release the audit to the Weekend Herald, citing privacy concerns, but said the review had led to “significant improvements”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several DHBs commented on the pressures facing their ICAMHS divisions. Measures they were taking included “targeted recruitment”, changing the care models they followed, reducing wait times for first contact, and improving facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a national level, the Government has started several initiatives for young people as part of its wider investments in <b>mental health</b>, although these are mainly aimed at early intervention in primary care and community settings in the hope of reducing demand over time rather than providing immediate relief to specialist services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Herald revealed the existence of a briefing by health officials to Andrew Little, the Minister of Health, which acknowledged serious problems in ICAMHS across the country. The services were not funded or staffed to keep up with the demand, the briefing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ICAMHS received funding of $3600 per patient while adult services got $5800 per patient, the document said, a longstanding disparity that “does not reflect current needs”. The workforce was under pressure, with staff leaving for less stressful and better paid jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The briefing acknowledged the number of children and teens needing help had increased significantly. The number of young seen in hospital emergency departments in crisis jumped by 177 per cent in a decade, “including a peak after the <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> lockdowns”, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, at the latest Budget, Labour allocated an extra $18.7 million for child and adolescent services, spread over four years, which it said would allow them to see another 1300 children annually by 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinicians say the pressures on ICAMHS are likely to grow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Mental health</b> services are caught in a storm of rising demand and crippling staffing shortages, and <b>Covid</b> is compounding the pressures. One teenager tells Investigations Editor Alex Spence their experience over several years left them disillusioned about how we care for some of our most vulnerable young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warning: This article discusses suicide attempts, self-harm and <b>mental health</b> problems and could be distressing for some people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning a week, Sam* spends a few hours hanging out with a support worker doing the sort of everyday activities most people take for granted — going for a swim, visiting the library. It’s a way of learning the confidence and skills they’ll need if they’re ever to live on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a mild Wednesday in early June, they’d planned to cook a meal together, but the support worker was exposed to <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>, so Sam instead spent the morning at home trying to find other things to occupy their restless mind. “Keeping myself busy so I don’t realise I have emotions,” is how Sam puts it. A colouring book rests on the kitchen counter. A jigsaw puzzle is spread on the dining table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam is 19, but seems much younger. Dressed in a hoodie and sweatpants, they sit at the dining table with one leg tucked under them, hands twiddling with a cube-shaped toy. Late-morning sun pours over hills behind the house, filling the living area with light. Sam’s father, an executive at a big company, is at work. Their mother, Jayne*, a self-employed professional, is busy in another room. Their dog is at a groomer for a day. The peaceful scene is starkly at odds with the story Sam is about to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have so much to talk about, because the system is so s***,” Sam says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam is one of a growing number of young Kiwis whose path to adulthood has been interrupted by <b>mental health</b> difficulties. Even before the <b>coronavirus</b> struck, rates of children and teenagers displaying signs of major psychological problems such as depression, anxiety and self-harm appeared to be rising significantly. It’s a trend that has been observed across high-income countries, for reasons that are not well understood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> amplified a slow-building crisis. Researchers, clinicians and parents say young people have been disproportionately impacted by the extraordinary stress and daily disruption the <b>pandemic</b> has brought, aggravating problems for those who were already vulnerable; causing new episodes of <b>mental illness</b>, and pushing many people into such acute distress that they become a danger to themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sam’s case, as they explain it, their experience was largely a consequence of autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that weren’t picked up when they were younger, gender dysphoria, and the problems these caused in adjusting to the world around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam is nonbinary, which means they identify as neither male nor female, and chooses to use gender-neutral pronouns such as “they” and “them”. Being both transgender and neurodiverse puts Sam at the intersection of two marginalised groups that have historically been poorly supported by public services and had alarmingly high rates of mental ill-health and suicide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since early adolescence, Sam has experienced persistent low moods, severe anxiety, and bursts of emotion so powerful and overwhelming that they took to regularly cutting their skin with razor blades to suppress them. By Jayne’s reckoning, Sam has tried to take their own life at least seven times in the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that time, Sam had contact with a succession of public services that left them profoundly disappointed by the level of care <b>New Zealand</b> provides to some of its most vulnerable young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam and Jayne are among dozens of people the Weekend Herald spoke to in recent months as part of an investigation into the state of <b>New Zealand</b>’s <b>mental health</b> system. To understand the pressure on services, we interviewed service users, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and health officials; reviewed data from more than 25 public bodies; and examined thousands of pages of government and health authority documents, many of which had not previously been made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reporting provides a troubling picture of a disjointed, underfunded, understaffed system that is more pressured than ever since the <b>coronavirus</b> outbreak. Confronted by increasing numbers of people needing urgent help at the same time as a desperate shortage of skilled workers, services across the country are struggling to provide a basic level of care, the investigation found — and the problem is especially critical in services for young people like Sam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam and Jayne agreed to speak on the condition that the Weekend Herald agree not to reveal their names or certain details that could be used to identify them. They also shared confidential medical records and correspondence with clinicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In multiple conversations and email exchanges over several weeks, they described immense frustration and concern at a system that, as they see it, failed Sam in numerous ways over many years. It misunderstood Sam’s complex needs, failed to provide effective care when Sam really needed it, and eventually all but gave up on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t want it to happen to another person ever again,” Sam says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAM WAS 12, in the second year of intermediate school, when they started to think there was something wrong with them beyond the usual adolescent struggles to fit in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a child, Sam showed some signs of neurodevelopmental differences. They were diagnosed at 9 with auditory processing disorder, which means they had difficulty understanding sounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back now, Jayne feels guilty that she didn’t pick up on Sam’s autism and ADHD earlier. But she didn’t know enough, and the signs weren’t clear enough, to raise suspicions. In many ways, Sam seemed like a “normal” child — happy and easygoing. It wasn’t until Sam reached early adolescence that it really became clear they were different to most of their peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Sam recalls, they found it hard to make eye contact. They didn’t laugh at jokes. While their peers explored teenage interests, Sam still liked playing with children’s toys. They kept to themself at breaks during the school day, preferring to read books on their own rather than socialising. They wore a hearing aid to help with their sensory processing problems, which some classmates mocked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differences were all too obvious to other kids, and Sam was bullied relentlessly, Jayne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jayne recalls a noticeable change in Sam’s demeanour and behaviour at that time. Sam lost friends and struggled to make new ones. They were reluctant to go to school. They seemed constantly unhappy and exploded when upset. Several times they ran away during arguments. Jayne now believes these were autistic “meltdowns”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sam was struggling to operate in the world,” Jayne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam muddled through at school, doing well enough at their studies not to draw attention from the teachers, but Sam says the sensory assault was increasingly intolerable. As they describe it, ADHD is like having a six-lane highway with no traffic rules in your head, with information veering in all directions at high speeds. Just getting through a lesson without erupting took a lot of effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I got overwhelmed so easily,” Sam says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It came to a head after Sam moved to secondary school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jayne took Sam to the family GP, who referred them for counselling. “It was a waste of time,” Sam says, “because the counsellor was like, ‘You’re not depressed, you’re just having normal teenage problems.”’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the counsellor didn’t know, however, was that Sam had secretly begun self-harming, cutting themselves to suppress their emotional pain. “It felt better than what I was feeling,” Sam says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Sam mentioned the self-harm to a guidance counsellor at school, the counsellor told Sam’s parents. Jayne took Sam back to the family doctor, who referred them to their local specialist <b>mental health</b> service for children and adolescents. (Sam has asked that the service not be named as it could identify them.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as “ICAMHS”, “CAMHS”, or “CAFS”, depending on the region, these services exist to provide expert care for under-18s with moderate or severe mental conditions, such as depression, eating disorders, and psychosis. Across the country, they saw around 51,000 children and teens last year, according to Ministry of Health figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, ICAHMS have become the agency of last resort for many traumatised and vulnerable <b>New Zealand</b> children. It is a role they are generally poorly equipped to play. As the Weekend Herald reports today, children’s services across the country are floundering even by the broken-down standards of the <b>mental health</b> sector, squeezed by record demand in the aftermath of the <b>pandemic</b> and a staffing crisis that has been years in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Sam began seeing ICAHMS, they were diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Jayne says she also pushed to have Sam assessed for autism but the clinicians refused, saying Sam didn’t “have enough traits” of the condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the service concentrated on managing Sam’s low mood, self-harm, and emerging gender dysphoria. Doctors prescribed several antidepressant medications, none of which seemed to work. Sam spent several months in a form of group therapy designed for people with borderline personality disorder, but found it unhelpful and even traumatic at times. “It was awful,” Jayne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam kept getting worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam and Jayne say that by overlooking Sam’s neurodevelopmental issues, the health professionals never properly got to grips with the cause of their mental distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think if my autism and ADHD were diagnosed early, pretty much all of it would have been avoided,” Sam says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major problem was that the staffing situation in ICAMHS — always precarious — was getting noticeably worse and affecting the quality of care the DHB could provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their best, specialist <b>mental health</b> services consist of “multidisciplinary” teams of skilled, experienced professionals — psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, occupational therapists and social workers — working closely and seamlessly to support the young person back to health. However, many services are so short-staffed that they can’t provide holistic, continuous treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The staff seemed to change constantly, Jayne says. Sam’s undiagnosed autism meant they had trouble communicating and interacting with people, and the high staff turnover made it even harder for them to form the sort of close bonds required in therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was no consistency of care,” Jayne says. “They just don’t have the numbers. They rotate. They quit. They go private.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn’t just lack of resources, in Sam’s view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They didn’t listen,” Sam says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from overlooking Sam’s neurodevelopmental challenges, Sam felt the staff didn’t understand them in other important ways. Although the staff sought to address Sam’s gender dysphoria, there didn’t seem to be a deep institutional understanding of what it means to be trans. When Sam came out as nonbinary, some staff continued using the wrong name and pronouns, including in their clinical notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’re sitting in a waiting room and someone calls your birth name,” Sam says. “How’s that make you feel?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Sam felt the professionals misunderstood the mentality behind self-harm, even though they spent a lot of time dwelling on it. “I don’t think I’ve met a single professional who really understood it,” they say, and then correct themself: “One of my psychologists had [self-harmed]. She was the only one who understood it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, Sam says, they felt pressured by staff to embrace the pro forma solutions on offer and treated as if it was their fault when they didn’t get better. It was invalidating and disheartening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam was discharged by ICAMHS a few months before they turned 18. The psychologist they’d been seeing was leaving, and the clinicians felt Sam was now well enough not to require ongoing specialist care. Jayne had her doubts. “I didn’t think it was a good idea,” she says. “I knew they weren’t well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAM HAD just started their final year of secondary school, in 2020, when the <b>coronavirus</b> reached <b>New Zealand</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As that year progressed, Jayne recalls, the disruption of the <b>pandemic</b> and the stresses of final exams collided with Sam’s already fragile emotional state to have a devastating impact on their <b>mental health</b>. A suicide attempt prompted a callout by a crisis response team and a referral to the DHB’s adult community <b>mental health</b> team. Sam managed to finish school — “I still don’t know what happened,” Jayne says — but they grew more acutely unwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days before Christmas that year, Sam was picked up by police in a distressed state on a motorway bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another night, just before new year, Jayne was making dinner when the police knocked at the front door. Sam, who was in their bedroom, had been communicating with a <b>mental health</b> helpline and a counsellor was so concerned they asked police to visit the house to do a wellness check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On another night, Sam was found by police in a local park after a suicide attempt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They took Sam to hospital, where they spent four days in an observation unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam’s parents insisted Sam wasn’t well enough to leave the hospital. “We can’t take them home,” Jayne recalls saying. “They’ve tried to commit suicide four times in a month.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam was admitted to an acute psychiatric unit. It was the first time they’d been away from their parents. “It was absolutely horrendous leaving them there,” Jayne says. “You feel guilty. You feel you’re a bad parent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a week, Sam asked to be discharged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many psychiatric facilities, the unit was rundown, understaffed and overcrowded with extremely unwell people — a disturbing place for an 18-year-old, let alone one with sensory processing difficulties. “It’s not helping people get better,” Sam says. “It’s a holding cell.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just wanted to go home.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A psychiatrist who saw Sam on the ward assessed them as having symptoms of an unspecified anxiety disorder, persistent depression, emerging traits of a possible personality disorder, and evidence of neurodiversity. Sam would be referred for therapy, the notes said, but there was a long waitlist to see a psychologist in the adult service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next several months, Sam made more suicide attempts, had encounters with the police and admissions to the emergency department. The follow-up care from the adult <b>mental health</b> service was minimal, Jayne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desperate, Jayne sought out private alternatives — although that, too, was difficult. The private sector also has a severe shortage of psychiatrists and psychologists who specialise in children and adolescents, and a surge in demand for their services has meant long waits to be seen at private clinics. Many private therapists are so busy they’ve stopped taking new patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, Jayne was convinced Sam was autistic, and spent hours searching the internet for psychologists who specialised in treating neurodiversity. She emailed anyone she could find, dozens of therapists, asking them to assess Sam. One wrote back, saying they would find time to speak to Sam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their first meeting, the clinical psychologist diagnosed Sam with ADHD. Based on the initial screening, the psychologist also said they suspected Sam was autistic. Eventually, that would be confirmed by a lengthy assessment that cost Jayne around $2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the car on the way home from the first appointment with the psychologist, Jayne and Sam felt relieved and vindicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a lightbulb moment,” Jayne says. “Finally somebody was listening to us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JAYNE, WHO is in her 50s, had a brief episode of <b>mental illness</b> when she was younger, but had never been in contact with the <b>mental health</b> system before Sam’s troubles began. It was an eye-opening experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One afternoon, she wrote an email setting out the main flaws she’d identified with the services, based on her family’s experience and conversations with other parents over the years. It’s not an exhaustive list, but it provides a pithy summary of the obstacles recounted by dozens of parents interviewed by the Weekend Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What I have learned over this time,” Jayne began, and proceeded to run through the problems:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s generally too little support for people who are mentally unwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The support that is available is inconsistent and too often inappropriate, unhelpful, not provided quickly enough or for long enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s a huge shortage of experienced, qualified <b>mental health</b> staff and we’re not doing enough to increase the numbers of people training in the field. Staff are leaving by the day because of the demands of the job and burnout caused by understaffing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When seeking help, service users and whānau are passed between professionals and providers so frequently that it’s unsettling. “There is no consistency of what little care is available and for a young person to have to tell their story over and over again is a further stress and trigger to their already fragile minds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s a big gap in provision for 18- to 25-year-olds who are too old for ICAMHS but aren’t well cared-for by adult services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the young people caught up in the <b>mental health</b> system are teens with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental problems — particularly ADHD and autism. We need more professionals, Jayne says, who can recognise and diagnose those conditions early and then treat them effectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few alternatives for families who can’t get timely and effective care through their overburdened public <b>mental health</b> services. “We cannot even get private help,” Jayne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Jayne wrote, there’s almost no support for parents thrust into a terrifying, confusing situation with usually a limited understanding of what is happening, what to expect, or how to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Jayne sees it, her family is more fortunate than many in the <b>mental health</b> system. She and her husband have a stable marriage and strong social ties to fall back on; they’re financially well-off; they’re health-literate and possessed of the self-confidence to lobby for their child. Despite all that, she says, they feel like they were defeated by the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It came at a huge personal cost. Being Sam’s principal advocate and carer has effectively been a full-time job, and a demanding one at that. There have been weeks, Jayne says, when she spent more than 40 hours trying to arrange care for Sam and only a few hours doing paid work for her clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All my energy goes into trying to get help and support for Sam.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jayne has barely stopped to process the toll it has had on her own <b>mental wellbeing</b>. She is still traumatised by dressing Sam’s wounds after they self-harmed, but has put off dealing with it. When she is out in public, she flinches when she hears the sirens of emergency vehicles, wondering if they are heading for Sam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been really stressful for us,” Jayne says. “We’ve gone to bed in tears at night because Sam’s been so distressed or they’ve hurt themselves again. You feel like a failure as a parent, you know? Why can I help my child? Why can’t I get help? We’re educated parents, we’ve got good jobs, we can fund stuff. But money doesn’t buy help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The hours and energy I spend on it, there’s nothing left,” she says. “When a child is unwell like that, you don’t get a break. We can’t go away together. We go away separately. Your relationship comes second. That’s been really hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can understand parents who split up. I can really understand how that happens. There have certainly been times I’ve felt like walking out and just going, ‘I can’t cope with any of this any more’.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some nights, Jayne lies awake in bed ruminating on what she could’ve done to spare Sam everything they’ve endured. What would Sam’s life be like now if they’d had better care when they were younger? Would they be at university? Flatting? Living independently?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we’d got the support early, and the correct support, it could’ve been different.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT’S NEARLY lunchtime. Sam has been talking for three-and-a-half hours, an unusual amount of time for them to spend with a stranger, but that shows how strongly Sam feels about the state of <b>mental health</b> services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jayne emerges from her home office. “I’ve just had a very grumpy call this morning,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has just got off the phone with the office of a psychiatrist who Sam saw by video call recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, Sam has all but given up on trying to get care through the public system and been seeking treatment privately instead. Sam says they’re seeking two things: a psychiatrist to prescribe and monitor the medication that keeps their ADHD in check; and a clinical psychologist with experience of treating transgender and neurodiverse clients to provide long-term therapy. But both are in extremely short supply across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took six months to get an appointment with a private psychiatrist, and Sam is still waiting for an appointment with a psychologist after more than a year of waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jayne says they’d pay almost any amount of money for treatment if it made Sam better, but there just aren’t the therapists available. “You can’t even get on waiting lists,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they finally secured an appointment with a psychiatrist earlier this year, it cost $500 for a half-hour session by video. Not nearly long enough, in Sam’s view, for the psychiatrist to understand their needs or for Sam to feel they’d established a connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Jayne was seeking another appointment to review Sam’s medication but the psychiatrist’s assistant said they’d have to pay hundreds of dollars more for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Really?” Sam says, their voice rising to a high pitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve googled psychiatrists,” Jayne says. “I’ve emailed a few this morning. I’ve even rung a few. But nobody’s taking new patients.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You would think the first appointment should get us to where we actually need to be,” Sam says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So now we’ve got no choice, hun,” Jayne says. “So I’ve booked it for tomorrow. And he’s got a space, which is quite lucky. Otherwise he’s booked until November.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a state of limbo, the family has learned to moderate expectations. Sam is at least steadier than they were a year ago. It has been months since they self-harmed or thought about taking their life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Day-to-day, they’re trying to follow modest routines to manage their <b>mental health</b>: get up at the same time every morning, have breakfast, take a shower, walk the dog, study for a few hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam has enrolled in an online paper at a university and is hoping to eventually study full-time. They’re talking about someday living on their own and pursuing a career supporting children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I want to get better,” Sam says. “I want to live independently. I want to have a job. I want to have a future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* names have been changed to protect the family’s privacy</p>

</div><div class="author">Amnesty International </div><div>379 words</div><div>23 June 2022</div><div>12:30</div><div>Scoop.co.nz</div><div>SCCONZ</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022, scoop.co.nz   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) has released new data indicating that <b>New Zealand</b> is falling seriously short when it comes to meeting human rights commitments across a number of areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amnesty International Aotearoa <b>New Zealand</b> is deeply concerned by this most recent data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We note a particularly concerning trend in relation to freedom from torture and ill-treatment, where, since 2017 <b>New Zealand</b>'s score appears to have been largely worsening (in 2017 the score was 7.3 out of 10 and decreased to 6.5 in the latest data).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked to provide more context, respondents mentioned the following:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Māori and Pasifika people experience ethnic profiling by police, and discriminatory legal systems</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- People suffering abuse in state care</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Police are less likely to help or investigate when it comes to protecting female victims</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Insufficient <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> measures in prisons put prisoners at risk due to poor ventilation, double-bunking, and lack of masks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Disabled people are more likely to be subject to restraint at school, in state care, and in <b>mental health</b> facilities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Police beatings and violence</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Māori people, especially Māori women, are at unique risk for violence by Corrections Officers in <b>New Zealand</b> prisons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest data adds to a staggering pattern of serious human rights concerns in the criminal justice system. In just two recent examples, the Chief Ombudsman described an incident at Auckland Prison as amounting to cruel treatment, and a District Court Judge found practices amounting to "degrading and fundamentally inhumane" treatment, as well as excessive use of force. <span class="companylink">Amnesty International</span> and others have documented many other serious human rights concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a clear need for fundamental, system-level change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issues threaded through our criminal justice system are complex and profound, but there are pathways forward. Among them are those set out by Ināia Tonu Nei and the extensive work done by other researchers and advocates over many years, including the hugely influential paper "He Whajpaanga Hou' by Moana Jackson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Amnesty International</span> calls on Minister Allan and Minister Davis to accept responsibility and bring transformational change by taking the bold steps needed to ensure our criminal justice system is fair and upholds human rights and dignity for all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hybrid working and the four-day work week are buzz terms in the current working environment, but what do New Zealanders prefer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research from <span class="companylink">Qualtrics</span>, a cloud-based experience management software firm, suggests <b>New Zealand</b> workers would prefer flexibility over a four-day work week, while raising concerns about the negative impacts of a shorter week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Qualtrics</span>’ research revealed more than half of full-time employees surveyed (60 per cent) would rather have the flexibility to work whenever they like across the week than have one-fewer days at work (40 per cent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flexibility was also a slightly bigger driver of retention among respondents (49 per cent) than a four-day work week (47 per cent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the benefits associated with a four-day work week, many respondents believed there would also be trade-offs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two-thirds (70 per cent) said they expect to work longer hours, while 63 per cent said customers would be frustrated, and 52 per cent said company performance would suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, 85 per cent of respondents said they were open to supporting their employer implementing a four-day work week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Among the buzz surrounding new working models, employers must not lose sight of the fact that what employees really want and have become accustomed to is the flexibility to adjust their work schedules to fit the demands of their lives,” said Dr Crissa Sumner, head of employee experience solution strategy at Qualtrics ANZ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the more than 500-strong survey, 49 per cent of respondents said flexibility means having control of the hours they work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost one-in-five said it was choosing what days they work, while 15 per cent said it was having the ability to work from any location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remote work was also a concern for more than half (53 per cent), who said they feel their career advancement will be negatively impacted if they work flexible hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sumner said employers have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the future of work for current and future workforces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s critical they deeply understand what employees expect to ensure the programmes adopted have a long-term positive impact.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>New Zealand</b>-based businessman and founder of Perpetual Guardian, Andrew Barnes, made headlines in 2018 when he introduced a four-day work week at the financial trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since introducing the policy, Barnes has said the results had been remarkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our productivity has gone up, our profits have gone up, our staff retention has improved, our stress levels have dropped,” Barnes previously told The AM Show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-day work week is a reduction in the work week from a standard 40 hours to 32 hours for the same pay and benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 20 companies from <b>Australia</b> and <b>New Zealand</b> will take part in a global four-day work week pilot programme — co-founded by Barnes and 4 Day Week Global’s chief executive Charlotte Lockhart — designed to track and measure the effectiveness of the growing trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-month trial will run from August to January 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial is already under way in Britain and involves more than 3300 workers at 70 companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are seeing a rebalancing effect in the global workforce, as a combination of the Great Resignation and the <b>pandemic</b> has amplified awareness of the need for employers to focus on retention strategies that prioritise wellbeing,” Lockhart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even before <b>Covid</b> it was apparent that people couldn’t keep working the way they had been — and now flexible working is not a nice-to-have but a must-have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of respondents (54per cent) of <span class="companylink">Qualtrics</span>’ research said their job was the main source of <b>mental health</b> challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most respondents said they would welcome their employer offering paid <b>mental health</b> days, with 90 per cent saying they would be a long-term solution to ensuring good <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sumner noted that for some, working remotely has had a negative impact on their <b>mental health</b>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creditors include taxman (owed $1m-plus), ex-staff and <span class="companylink">Westpac</span>
                     </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creditors of TV chef Ganesh Raj’s now shut restaurant include former staff, the tax department, which is owed more than $1 million, and <span class="companylink">Westpac</span> bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raj, the co-host of Eat Well For Less, and his wife Jo Ganesh made the tough call to place the Tasting Shed into liquidators’ hands on June 13, blaming the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> for the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by Paul Vlasic at Rodgers Reidy shows employees are owed wages and holiday pay totalling $9431 while the Inland Revenue has a claim in for $591,759 for GST and employer activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the former staff and the IRD are preferential creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IRD was also listed as an unsecured creditor owed $633,340, with other unsecured creditors owed $42,381. Vlasic warned it was unlikely funds would be available for unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“However, recovery actions through insolvent transactions and actions against certain other parties may bring in additional funds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liquidator was still investigating how much the company owed to secured creditors, which include alcohol distributors Hancocks Wine, Spirit and Beer Merchants, Lion <b>NZ</b>, Negociants <b>NZ</b>, Hardy Trade Supply, Vintners <b>NZ</b> and food suppliers Maison Vauron, Hardy Trade Supply Company and The Produce Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westpac <b>New Zealand</b> was also listed as having a security interest over the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company’s assets include plant and equipment, with an estimated realisation value of $39,153.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liquidator was investigating whether any money could be clawed back from action against certain parties, related party current accounts or voidable transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Vlasic said after looking at company assets and liabilities it was decided to dispense with a creditors’ meeting, though creditors were still encouraged to contact him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The restaurant’s last day of trading was June 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple set it up in 2010, converting a rundown cider shed in Waimauku.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It had been for sale since November 2020 after another business part-owned by Ganesh Raj — the Māori Kitchen — went into liquidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raj said in a statement last week they had made the difficult decision to wind up The Tasting Shed after it was no longer able to pay operating expenses, taxes and rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is with a heavy heart that we have made this decision after exhausting all the financial options available to us. We tried hard to ride out the effects of the <b>pandemic</b> but the impact on hospitality has been too hard for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the cost of goods and services had risen greatly and there were fewer people to fill staffing vacancies — an industry-wide issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Like many others in this industry, the impacts of the last two years on our business have taken an immense toll on the <b>mental health</b> of myself and my family, a key factor in making this difficult decision.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The restaurant is the latest scalp claimed by <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2021, Elijah Blue, an eatery overlooking the water near Hobsonville Marina, was placed into liquidation. Liquidator Grant Reynolds cited “the effect of <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b> on the hospitality industry” and lease issues for its insolvency issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sustainable and organic cafe Misters Real Food in the city centre was also placed in liquidation in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And two leading restaurants on the Auckland waterfront, Euro and Saxon + Parole, were also forced to close last year due to <b>Covid</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Euro was home to celebrity chefs such as Simon Gault and was legendary for its long lunches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saxon + Parole was described as a “modern steakhouse from New York” and opened in the retail hub of Commercial Bay at the untimely start of the <b>Covid</b><b>-19 pandemic</b> in 2020.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former All Black Carl Hayman has spoken publicly for the first time since revealing last year he is living with early onset dementia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hayman was speaking on TVNZ's Seven Sharp as part of a dementia awareness event, "A Light in the Darkness', designed to show all those who live with dementia, and all those who care for them, that they are not forgotten about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 42 year old father of four children who played 46 tests for the All Blacks between 2001 and 2007 says he was prepared to live with a sore knee or sore back for the rest of his days after rugby, but to have a medical specialist tell him he had dementia is something he never thought he would need to deal with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've got various symptoms from changes in mood, to forgetfulness to constant headaches. It was pretty much zapping the life out of me really," says Hayman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been incredibly tough, but it's a matter of accepting that my brain energy is half full compared to other people, so I need to be careful about what I use that energy on. I need to plan my day, not take too much on and have little achievable goals for the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having that understanding and the tools to help deal with things, has really given me hope to move forward, in terms of having a productive future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dementia Auckland CEO, Martin Bremner, is incredibly grateful for the courage and sincerity displayed by Hayman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our goal is to bring the same level of awareness and acceptance to dementia that John Kirwan has done for <b>mental health</b> in recent years, and Carl has taken a massive first step in helping us achieve that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We couldn't be more appreciative of the incredibly selfless and courageous way Carl has acted, and we know that what he has done will have an extremely positive impact on people living with dementia in our communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bremner says Dementia is like a <b>lockdown</b> that never ends for those who live with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's why we wanted to be that "light in the darkness' to show and send a message of hope to them all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dementia is now the third largest cause of death in <b>New Zealand</b> and by 2050 it is anticipated that one in four New Zealanders will die with the dementia condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hayman was on hand at Auckland's Bayswater Marina last night to flick the switch on a powerful spotlight that shone a vertical shaft of teal light 1,000 feet into <b>New Zealand</b>'s longest, darkest night sky on the winter solstice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A Light in the Darkness' is a powerful visual initiative that we are delighted to be involved in to grow the engagement and understanding of how dementia impacts - and will impact - so many New Zealanders," says Bremner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Funding for Dementia support services in <b>New Zealand</b> is at a critical level and we don't want to be in a situation of having to cut back on the support we offer those in need. So if anyone is able to assist please visit our Dementia Auckland website da.org.<b>nz</b>"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>NZ</b> Dementia stats projected by 2050:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dementia will cost <b>New Zealand</b> nearly $6 billion every year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Kiwis living with dementia will grow from 70,000 to 170,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Europeans living with dementia in Aotearoa <b>NZ</b> is projected to almost double from 60,500 to 106,500</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dementia (mate wareware) among Māori will almost triple (4300 to 12,030) and increase significantly among the Pasifika (1930 to 5450) and Asian populations (4800 to 17,990).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some it is a secret, others are oblivious and for most there is the fear of being "judged' - of being deemed unemployable - but one Kiwi is bringing the hidden problem of dyslexia to the world via the podcast Truth About Dyslexia and this month it cracked more than 510,000 downloads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Podcaster and co-director of Remarkable Minds, Stephen Martin was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of ten. "I knew I had it, but nobody told me what it was or what to do about it - I just thought I would grow out of it, but of course you don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to bring dyslexia into the light; to clear up misconceptions and show people how the mind operates. I want to enable others with dyslexia to understand themselves and thrive in life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin says there are thousands of undiagnosed dyslexics all around the globe. They are smart at hiding their challenges, but they don't understand what is really going on and why they are the way they are. This takes an enormous toll on their <b>mental health</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like a broken leg, you can't see the challenges with the naked eye. Dyslexia is much more widespread than people realise, in fact according to research approximately 20 percent of the population are dyslexic - that is across all walks of life, so if you are working in an office there is a high chance that you are sitting across from a dyslexic adult. Many dyslexics find strategies for coping, but sadly for 10 percent of dyslexics there can be real problems in dealing with life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The <b>mental health</b> impact of the <b>pandemic</b> has made it incredibly difficult for many with dyslexia to cope because it has forced changes to how they operate and live. For example, dyslexic people rely heavily on visual cues. Text messages and emails are difficult and wrought with anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The podcast is about helping people understand that spiral and how to get out of it. I am on a mission to give people the tools to help them succeed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one email from a listener in Arizona, USA wrote: "I love the podcast. It was the missing puzzle piece to what I needed! Thank you so much. I didn't realise how dyslexia impacted my adult life. Learning about the full truth about dyslexia is so helpful. It has dramatically improved my health and life!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin says the key is creating an open conversation to bring dyslexia out into the light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Dyslexic people are incredibly hard on themselves, they just won't cut themselves a break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reality is that dyslexic people can make valuable contributions to any organisation - we have brilliant puzzle solving abilities, spatial reasoning, communication and conversation skills, as well as being extraordinary at abstract, critical and original thinking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online and other assessments&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you suspect that you or somebody in your family has dyslexia, get assessed. There are free online assessments, and even some <b>New Zealand</b> psychiatrist's websites offer free online assessments. The website https://truthaboutdyslexia.com/[https://truthaboutdyslexia.com/] offers a free assessment for adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Getting assessed by a professional can be really expensive and you may face a long wait for an appointment. An online assessment will at least give you an indication of whether to take the next step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is called the hidden disability for a reason. For as long as it remains hidden it is a disability. Once you bring it into the light you can make it your superpower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Build Your Awareness&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin suggests that those who suspect they have dyslexia or who have been assessed as having dyslexia should do as much research online as possible to equip themselves with a broader toolkit to navigate life with dyslexia. There are also a number of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> groups people can join.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The podcast https://truthaboutdyslexia.com/adult-dyslexia-podcast/[https://truthaboutdyslexia.com/adult-dyslexia-podcast/] was created to help make life easier for dyslexics, offering tools, advice, connection and inspiration - that's the reason why it's so popular."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about it&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin says anybody with dyslexia is encouraged to embrace their remarkable mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You are not stupid or a failure. You do not need to live with anxiety, shame and confusion. Embrace your dyslexia and you will get the help and support you need. Hide it and you will continue to struggle alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being an adult with dyslexia and feeling like you are all alone is the worst place that you can be. That loneliness and <b>isolation</b> can lead to real and painful <b>mental health</b> struggles. We see it all the time. Overthinking everything you do, feeling stupid or a failure. It is not true at all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relief that people feel when they find the Truth About Dyslexia podcast and realise that they are not alone is enormous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Seek out people like you, find a community where you can share your experiences and challenges. You'll soon find that so many other people feel just like you do, and you'll feel less alone."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only minor steps taken to protect teens and young girls on <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> argues critic. Nick Bonyhady reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--------------------</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents will be able to limit the amount of time their children spend on <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>, see follower lists and be notified about inappropriate behaviour reports in a suite of changes the social media service implemented on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move follows sustained criticism of <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> and its parent company <span class="companylink">Meta</span> late last year from activists, regulators and politicians that was elevated by the leak of internal documents suggesting <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> was bad for teenage girls' self-esteem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Meta</span> disputed many of the claims by whistleblower Frances Haugen at the time, but Wednesday's changes go some distance toward addressing one of her primary concerns: that teens' <b>mental health</b> was spiralling down as they scrolled through feeds on <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> filled with images of people seemingly better looking and happier than them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Meta</span> regional public policy director Mia Garlick said the changes were not a response to Haugen's criticism but part of the company's long-term work to protect young people by starting conversations within families, while also respecting their autonomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people value the role of social media, particularly keeping people connected during the <b>pandemic</b>, but where it starts to interfere with doing homework or doing chores, that's when people have concerns," Garlick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A parent or child (the minimum age allowed on <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> is 13) can request to set up the parental supervision tools, but it does not work unless both agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the arrangement is running, parents will be able to set screen-time limits of between 15 minutes and two hours and schedule breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So you could, for example, set [<span class="companylink">Instagram</span>] to only be available on the weekends or be blocked during school hours," Garlick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents will also be able to see who is following their child and who their child is following. If the teen reports inappropriate behaviour on <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>, they can also notify their parent via the app.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes were made available in the United States in March but Garlick said the Australian launch date was determined by a need to consult with local experts and regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other changes operate without the need for parental involvement. Teens will get nudges to encourage them to view other posts if they are obsessively viewing images of one kind and, if they have been watching short form videos called Reels for lengthy periods, reminders to turn on a feature that encourages them to periodically close the app. The user can ignore those prompts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new online toolkit will also include material from anti- bullying, body image and <b>mental health</b> groups PROJECT ROCKIT, ReachOut and Butterfly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROCKIT's co-founder Lucy Thomas said <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> had taken a "pivotal step" that would help parents help their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Chris Cooper, executive director of Reset <b>Australia</b> and a critic of social media's treatment of children, said <span class="companylink">Meta</span> had not made significant changes that would make its platform safe for young girls. "The changes that do need to be made would affect the business model and profit [of <span class="companylink">Meta</span>]," Cooper said - adding, for example, algorithmic changes to avoid amplifying harmful content that could encourage things such as disordered eating. He spoke in general terms because <span class="companylink">Meta</span> had not made its changes public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garlick said <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> had made other changes to manage those concerns, such as limits on some types of body image content, partnerships with NGOs, and options for users to hide how many people had "liked" a post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haugen, the whistleblower, told Australian MPs last year to be cynical of promises by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to reform and address its problems. In her view, it was aware of its negative impact on teen girls but did not change its practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> is 'toxic' for teen girls," the company said at the time. - Sydney Morning Herald</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear if the parental controls will be implemented in <b>New Zealand</b> as yet. <span class="companylink">Meta</span> was contacted for clarity, but had not responded before we went to press.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasoned firefighter John Rowe attended a recent callout where he had to perform CPR on a 3-month-old baby. The child didn't make it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rowe later found out the death was being treated as a suspected murder. He thought of his own grandchild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the 0800 <b>mental health</b> support number provided to firefighters - they were "too busy".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Rowe, this was the final straw. After 32 years, he no longer works as a frontline firefighter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, members of the Professional Firefighters Union went on a partial strike, refusing to complete any mandatory administrative tasks, like gathering statistics, non-essential paperwork, training and attending conferences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The union and Fire and Emergency <b>New Zealand</b> (Fenz) have hit an impasse after more than a year of bargaining, with the union not ruling out escalating strike action if a deal cannot be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are issues with pay, staffing levels and equipment, but top of firefighters' list of grievances is a lack of <b>mental-health</b> support and awareness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porirua firefighter Jay Elkington said fire crews were almost always the first on the scene when called to a "purple incident" - that's when a person is near- death or dying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2013, firefighters have been required to respond to these incidents alongside ambulance staff, but they felt ill- equipped to deal with what they faced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got a bag of bandages, Gladwrap, plasters and bottles of salty water on hand to respond to serious car accidents, suicides and stabbing victims."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past week, Elkington has attended three incidents where someone required CPR. In two of these cases, the person did not survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being in the job so long, you become desensitised to a certain degree," he said. But it was the families that stuck with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got a crying wife . . . pleading with us to bring them back. Or the children. We don't get trained, or any help, to deal with that stuff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Elkington drives past houses in his neighbourhood, he remembers what happened there - the incident, the wife, the children. But he doesn't know what happened after they closed the ambulance door. "It would be nice to know if they make it or not. It would give us some closure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elkington said he wanted officers to be trained to recognise what trauma looked like and for processes that removed the pressure on firefighters to self-report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know what <b>mental-health</b> trauma looks like, or if I am suffering from it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colleague Bret Burrows said, from the coal face, the current support systems and processes felt like "a tick-box exercise".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This system relies on self-referral and if someone is struggling, they aren't always in the right frame of mind to self refer," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A system where professionals routinely monitor firefighters' wellbeing is needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, crews are supposed to do a debrief after every call-out, but whether that happened depended on the severity of the incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect was cumulative, he said. "While you're still processing one, you get pinged, and you have to go to another one. It all adds up over time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firefighters didn't feel supported by management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fenz deputy national commander Brendan Nally said firefighters were provided with free counselling and professional psychological support services. Counselling was also available to firefighters' immediate family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national body had offered to work with the union to improve and develop <b>mental-health</b> support and education, Nally said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't just the nature of the incidents, it's also the number of hours firefighters are having to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the firefighters spoken to said they'd had to work between 86 and 100 hours a week on countless occasions, in an effort to keep fire trucks on the run and prevent Wellington fire stations closing for the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some firefighters in the region were racking up more than 300 hours a month due to staff shortages. These shortages also made responding to incidents more dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nally said firefighters worked 42 hours a week on average, before overtime, based on two-day shifts, followed by two night shifts, and four days off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am aware some personnel occasionally work long hours, and like many organisations, we have recently been impacted by absences due to <b>Covid</b><b>-19</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nally said he appreciated the "extra mahi" and the need to balance that against fatigue and other pressures, while pointing to the organisation's fatigue- management policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a previous statement, Fenz chief executive Kerry Gregory said personnel occasionally worked long hours, but he was not aware of anyone routinely doing 80, 90 or 100 hours a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burrows said it was hard to hear Fenz downplaying their struggles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recurring response was, "we're looking into it". But that wasn't good enough, he said. "It's like, we're just going to throw some more money at it and a bunch of people are going to sit around and talk about it, but it won't actually affect what's happening."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burrows said the extra hours and stress had a knock-on effect. "If you're selling your free time, something's got to give - whether it's family life, your loved ones, your own <b>mental health</b> and wellbeing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wattie Watson, secretary of the <span class="companylink"><b>New Zealand</b> Professional Firefighters' Union</span>, said all these issues had compounded to cause a fire crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parties were deadlocked at the end of one day of mediation on Thursday and Fenz had declined to meet for any further meetings until the union put forward a lower remuneration claim, Watson said. "The relationship is at its lowest ever."</p>
