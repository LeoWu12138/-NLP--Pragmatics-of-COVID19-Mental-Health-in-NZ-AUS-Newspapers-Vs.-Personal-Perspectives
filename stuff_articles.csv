"The more lockdowns Auckland is placed under, the more people are likely to struggle with their mental health, a psychologist says, as calls to helplines surge.","05:00, Sep 08 2021","The more lockdowns Auckland is placed under, the more people are likely to struggle with their mental health, a psychologist says, as calls to helplines surge. As the rest of the country is waking up to life at alert level 2, Auckland remains under strict alert level 4 restrictions as new cases of Covid-19 continue to be reported in the community. This is Auckland’s fifth lockdown, having been put in alert level 4 or 3 more times than any other region.

 Dr Sarah Cowie, a senior lecturer at Auckland University’s school of psychology, said people had coped with this lockdown as well as they could, but seeing other parts of the country get more freedoms might be tough for some. READ MORE:

  “... We do know the more lockdowns we have the harder people tend to find it, the more exhausting people tend to find it, and I guess, the more aware of the economic pressures [they are].”David White/StuffAuckland’s CBD remains quiet as the city stays in alert level 4 for at least another week. Cowie said going into lockdown “definitely” affected people’s mental health but to what degree depended on their personal circumstances. “I think it’s probably fair to say across the board that when you feel like you are doing something not out of choice, that knocks your sense of control and might make you feel a bit anxious,” she said. “There are people who are experiencing quite serious mental health difficulties because of being locked down.” Lifeline operations manager Helena de Fontenay said the number of calls and texts to its helpline had increased almost 40 per cent this lockdown compared to the alert level 4 lockdown in March and April last year.



 Most of its calls came from Aucklanders, and it was “great” they were reaching out for support, de Fontenay said. “Our callers’ biggest reported issue is that they are lonely and isolated. For texters, it’s relationship difficulties.” “They are stuck at home with their parents, or their flatmates, or they’re in a relationship that’s broken up, but they can’t leave the house.” De Fontenay said many people were just looking to get support in any way they could, and Lifeline staff were really glad to be there for people.Chris McKeen/StuffBoundary patrols are in place north and south of Auckland to control who is leaving the city. De Fontenay said statistics showed people often felt more anxious around the time lockdown announcements were made. In the first week of the current lockdown, the helpline received 8500 calls. That rose to 8700 in the second week and to 10,900 last week. “Most of our calls do come from Auckland, so we are still going through another week of lockdown,” she said. “I know myself I am home with a 4-year-old, trying to do full-time work and manage a kid. It’s stressful for everyone.” De Fontenay said Lifeline staff and volunteers were doing what they could to keep up with the demand. However, support, such as donations, would help boost that support, and its Christchurch office reopening in alert level 2 would also help.SuppliedSenior lecturer of Auckland University’s school of psychology Dr Sarah Cowie. Cowie said Aucklanders seeing the rest of the country move to alert level 2 may make life in alert level 4 harder for some as they would see others doing things they enjoy but can’t do themselves. But she didn’t believe it would make Aucklanders want to go out and break the rules. “As long as we keep seeing people in our immediate environment being compliant, then we should still be compliant.” On August 29, Health Minister Andrew Little announced a $1 million fund aimed at community-led projects to support youth mental health in Auckland and Northland in response to the Delta outbreak. “We have learned from previous lockdowns that they are particularly challenging for young people and that the greatest need for support for young people in Aotearoa kicks in around two weeks in,” Little said. Youthline was also given a further $275,000 at the beginning of lockdown, Little’s office said.

"Mental health conditions amongst Kiwi youth have doubled in the past decade, and could get worse in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to research out of Koi Tū: The Centre for Informed Futures at The University of Auckland.","05:00, Sep 03 2020","Mental health conditions amongst Kiwi youth have doubled in the past decade, and could get worse in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to research out of Koi Tū: The Centre for Informed Futures at The University of Auckland. Experts have described the country’s mental health woes as “a silent pandemic of psychological distress”, and are calling for urgent action to better understand the rapid rise in issues amongst youth. Psychologists and academics want to know more about the factors that impact on mental health, and effective strategies for prevention and intervention. The collection of experts providing commentary on the matter were Sir Peter Gluckman, professor Richie Poulton and Rochelle Menzies. READ MORE:

 * Coronavirus: Government not using all the tools in the fight against Covid-19, says former chief scientist
  They said the past decade has seen a “rapid and concerning rise” in youth psychological distress and suicide rates. “Nationally, poor mental health for youth is persistently inequitable and worsening.” The as yet unknown impacts of Covid-19 on youth are likely to be extensive and enduring, exacerbating young people’s already declining mental wellbeing, the experts said. “Covid-19 has added fuel to the fire, and protecting and promoting mental wellbeing for youth is now a matter of urgency for the Government and health officials,” Poulton said. “These issues predated Covid-19, but it came along and just poured psychological gasoline on an already vulnerable group.”123RFThe survey showed on average, girls and young women were suffering with symptoms of depression more than their male counterparts. (File photo) Nearly a quarter of the youth surveyed were reportedly mentally unwell, and Gluckman said the issue hadn’t received the attention and actions it deserved. The collective is calling for a new, fit-for-purpose baseline study of children and adolescents to understand the context and conditions underpinning the mental health of New Zealand’s youth. The commentary follows the followed the Youth 19 survey of 7721 school students, aged 13-19 years. That painted a bleak picture, with 23 per cent (29 per cent of females and 17 per cent of males) reporting symptoms of depression, about twice the rate of 2012.



 Six per cent of those surveyed reported they had attempted suicide in the previous 12 months. For males, 2.2 per cent of whom had attempted suicide, that was twice the rate as that reported in 2012. The study also found 38 per cent of Māori and 37 per cent of Pasifika females reported depression, compared to 24 per cent of Pākehā females. For lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex young people, the numbers were higher still, with 57 per cent reporting they had experienced symptoms of depression.

"The people leading our Covid response deserve scrutiny, but not endless criticism, writes Jehan Casinader.","05:00, Aug 29 2021","The people leading our Covid response deserve scrutiny, but not endless criticism, writes Jehan Casinader. A few weeks before Delta grabbed us by the throat, Covid Minister Chris Hipkins sat alone in Wellington Airport, staring blankly at his laptop. He looked shattered. There were no aides with him – no-one to answer his phone, organise his paperwork or make him a cup of tea. Of all the health ministers in the developed world, how many would find themselves travelling alone during the pandemic? Hipkins sat beneath a TV screen with his own face on it. The headlines included bleak projections about the likelihood of another outbreak. READ MORE:

	 I watched a man walk past and offer an encouraging word: “Good job, mate.” Hipkins smiled wearily before returning to his laptop, with his brow furrowed. At the gate, the man in charge of our Covid response put on his facemask, while other passengers grumbled about why they had to wear a mask at all. In New Zealand, our political leaders are familiar and accessible. We expect them to live unpretentiously – and to carry their own luggage. But perhaps that makes us blind to the unrelenting pressure they face on a daily basis. During the lockdown, a reassuring quote has been doing the rounds: “You’re not working from home. You’re at home, during a crisis, trying to work.” It’s a nice sentiment. But why haven’t we extended the same grace and goodwill to those who’re in charge?ROBERT KITCHIN/StuffCovid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins and Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield, on the Beehive theatrette platform for another round. Politicians and public servants are at work, during a crisis, trying to protect 5 million people from a mutating virus that spreads through the air. How are they rewarded for their trouble? Endless whining and moaning from a large segment of the public. Over the past fortnight, social media pages have been filled with gripes. Why did we lock down with only one case? Why did we even need a lockdown? Why are we still in lockdown? Why won’t they tell us how long we’ll be in lockdown? We’re like 5 million children squeezed into the backseat of a station wagon, chanting: “Are we there yet?” When this outbreak began, our narrative quickly shifted from “a world-leading response” to “a failing, poorly-led public service”.



 Clearly, there have been gaps in the Government’s Covid strategy. The vaccine roll-out has been slow. The MIQ system remains inequitable. The border has been exposed on many occasions. But too often, the criticism overlooks the fact that politicians and officials are making imperfect decisions, based on imperfect information, using limited public resources, during an unprecedented global event. There is no textbook for this stuff. The prime minister has been accused of exploiting Covid to build her personal brand. I’ve read numerous posts claiming Jacinda Ardern enjoys Level 4 because she can hog the limelight and deliver Labour “sermons” from the Beehive theatrette. This is daft – and just plain nasty. In February, Ardern said there is an “indescribable anxiety that comes with the daily grind of managing a pandemic”.Pool/Getty ImagesPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern has copped flak for the speed of the vaccine roll-out. Ashley Bloomfield is not immune to it. While delivering daily press conferences, he says his cortisol level spikes and he begins to sweat at the same time each morning – even on his days off. Ministers are also unable to switch off. On August 20, Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall and other senior MPs were woken at 2am with news of a case at a hospital. Does this sound like a (physically-distanced) walk in the park? Can you imagine the pressure? Facebook’s keyboard warriors and armchair epidemiologists wouldn’t last a day in these roles. Our Covid response also relies on thousands of people across the public sector, including the workers often derided as “bureaucrats”.





 If you expect “the Government” to do anything, a human has to do it. Paying out subsidies. Running helplines. Ordering nasal swabs. Updating the Covid website. Collating complex data on active cases. A few days ago, when the Ministry of Health’s 1pm email failed to appear on time, people on Twitter were tapping their watches and rolling their eyes – and even suggesting that officials were operating on “public servant time”. Were those officials sitting around eating Cameo Cremes? Or were they desperately trying to verify crucial information before releasing it to the public? For 17 months, many government workers have been under sustained psychological pressure, working punishing hours while trying to meet the expectations of a fickle public.Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayUnmuteCurrent Time /Duration Loaded: 0%Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently playing liveLIVERemaining Time - 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Tracken (Main), selectedFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

These people are not robots. Even during an outbreak, they have to eat, sleep, go to the toilet and home-school their kids. I’m sure many lie awake scrolling through social media, reading vitriolic posts about their decision-making – and their character. Even high profile experts on the pandemic carry the emotional burden of leading during a crisis. In 2020, Dr Siouxsie Wiles was filmed crying as Ardern announced we would go to Level 4. Professor Michael Baker broke down during a TV interview. Professor Shaun Hendy says he “cried quietly” when it was announced we would return to Level 1. The reason we have got this far is because hundreds of people have sacrificed their own wellbeing in order to design and execute the Covid response. That’s because they care about their work.

 Their greatest accomplishments will go unremarked. We don’t know how many times our border measures successfully halted the virus. Or how many times we avoided our hospitals being overrun. Or how many businesses were saved. Or how many Kiwis were spared the trauma of burying a loved one. Yes, ministers and public servants must be held accountable for their failings. But every time we slag them off, every time we tell them how useless they are, we trash their contribution, and make a mockery of our own proclamations about the importance of mental health. It would make a big difference to the mood of the country if each of us spent less time complaining about the Government’s response, and more time focused on our own response. Everyone’s wellbeing will be better for it.

Morrinsville College principal John Inger said students and parents should not expect any significant direct online teaching for the next three days. “We’re not panicking at the moment, we need to see what the national situation is before we put unnecessary pressure on our students and teachers,” Inger told Stuff. Inger said after the first lockdown in 2020, “we learnt that some people don’t cope well with this, and we hope there won’t be too many kids affected by not being able to come to school”.Sharnae Hope/StuffMorrinsville College principal John Inger wants students to take it easy in lockdown. The mental health of students, staff and parents is paramount, he said. “Parents become teachers, teachers while still teaching need to look after their own families, and students often become caregivers for their other siblings.” From Thursday, Morrinsville College senior students will be able to contact their teachers through Google Classroom and email, as teachers progressively put more resources online.Kelly Hodel/StuffFairfield Intermediate School’s empty school grounds. For the juniors, they are able to continue with “Education Perfect work”, however, there is no expectation for students and teachers to focus on providing work for junior students this week. The staff will go into “full gear” if the lockdown extends, he said. “We know that some of our local Morrinsville people go up to the Coromandel area in the weekends, so we’re not discounting the possibility that it could be in our own community. We hope not, but we will see,” Inger said.Chloe Blommerde/StuffLeamington Primary School is empty, normally swamped with students.  Since New Zealand went into lockdown in 2020, young people have had it tough. School students spent weeks at home, adjusting to learning online, and for those in tertiary education, worries regarding accommodation loomed as thousands of students left their university halls, but were still responsible for paying rent. There was a 40 per cent rise in people contacting National Telehealth Service’s mental health service post-lockdown. In the first quarter of 2020-21 (July to September) – the service was contacted 55,654, compared to 39,188 times during the same period the year before.  In Hamilton, Fraser High School principal Virginia Crawford reminded caregivers via email that lockdown can be tiring, frustrating and tense.KELLY HODEL/STUFFFairfield Primary School, empty playground. “Please try not to be anxious about your child’s learning and assessments during the lockdown period,” it read. Students were asked if able, to check their online classroom, or keep up to date on the closed social media page. New Zealand Post Primary Teachers' Association president Melanie Webber said mental health has always been a priority in lockdown, but schools are more aware of the impacts now.  “We need to prioritise that it’s about wellbeing and getting through. “We can only do our absolute best, students may be disadvantaged and slip behind, but it’s the reality and, once we get back to school, we will manage it. “If you can’t look after yourself, you can't look after your students.”suppliedMelanie Webber, president of New Zealand Post Primary Teachers’ Association, said each school can decide how it responds under alert level 4. The Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education has not allowed devices or hard pack resources to be distributed and collected like it did last year, due to the increase in infection.

That’s the advice mental health experts are giving to those struggling after New Zealand was suddenly plunged into its second national lockdown.  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the whole country would be in alert level 4 for at least three days after a 58-year-old Auckland man contracted the Delta variant of Covid-19. It is the country’s first community case in almost six months.STACY SQUIRES/StuffMassive queues at Christchurch's Orchard Rd Covid-19 testing station on the first day of the second national lockdown.

  Auckland and the Coromandel, where the first reported case has been in recent days, will remain in lockdown for at least seven days. Ministry of Health mental health and addiction chief clinical adviser Dr Arran Culver​said while it was still too early to identify any trends since moving to alert level 4, the abrupt change may have caused distress for some people.  Culver expected trends in mental health and wellbeing needs would be similar to previous periods of higher alert levels. While most people continued to enjoy high levels of wellbeing, some people would experience a significant drop during level 4, particularly those aged under 25. Lawrence Smith/StuffWhile it was still too early to identify any trends since moving to alert level four, the abrupt change may have caused distress for some people, particularly those under 25. (File photo). “Young people were most impacted previously, and it is likely that we will see this trend again, depending on the duration of the increased alert level.” It was important people knew it was normal to not feel alright all the time, Culver said.  “It’s understandable to feel sad, distressed, worried, confused, anxious or angry during this crisis. Everyone reacts differently to difficult events, and some may find this time more challenging than others.”  He suggested Kiwis should stay connected, limit time online, stick to a schedule or routine, exercise daily, explore their local neighbourhood, and appreciate small moments of joy. 



 Whakarongorau Aotearoa runs Telehealth Services, which provides free counselling and peer support services for Kiwis. Psychiatrist Dr David Codyre​ said its mental health and addictions services answered 517 calls on Tuesday, mainly through its 1737 helpline – similar to what was usually observed on a Tuesday in August.  The helpline answered 619 calls on Wednesday, 15 per cent fewer calls than during the first day of the first national lockdown last year. “New Zealanders are well-prepared and know what to do in their lockdown bubbles.” Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayUnmuteCurrent Time /Duration Loaded: 0%Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently playing liveLIVERemaining Time - 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Tracken (Main), selectedFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Having to change appointments, some of which were for referrals to other health services and benefits, and the uncertainty with how long the lockdown would be, increased their anxiety. Cantabrians were “well versed in disaster response” given recent crises such as the Canterbury earthquakes and the March 15 mosque shootings, she said.

 During the last national lockdown many people who needed help initially tried to “tough it out”, but soon burnt out. “Our community is quite used to having sudden distress and coping with it for a certain amount of time. However, when they ran out of that resilience they seriously ran out of it totally.” She said it appeared many of those suffering did not go forward because they did not want to put the pressure onto someone else. Nobes expected this pattern would emerge again during the current national lockdown. She encouraged anyone who was struggling to seek support and go easy on themselves. “Don't tough it out, don't let it build up to something that isn't easy to handle anymore – talk to people. “Don't expect [too much] from yourself, just cope – coping is all that's required.”  A plethora of online mental health resources, including wellbeing apps, e-books and helplines, are available for those in need. Many can be accessed through the Mental Health Foundation or the Mental Health Education and Resource Centre.

A surge in child mental health cases is expected to place even more pressure on a system already in crisis as the chair of New Zealand’s Faculty of Child Psychiatry warns the worst is yet to come with all hospitals experiencing shortages of clinical mental health staff.,"05:00, Mar 22 2022","A surge in child mental health cases is expected to place even more pressure on a system already in crisis as the chair of New Zealand’s Faculty of Child Psychiatry warns the worst is yet to come with all hospitals experiencing shortages of clinical mental health staff. Dr Tanya Wright​ said every child and adolescent mental health service in the country was understaffed by at least 25 per cent, while Wellington was short about 40 per cent of its fulltime clinical roles. District health boards around the country said they were seeing more demand for child and adolescent mental health services than before the Covid-19 pandemic began. The unprecedented crisis in the public health system as a result of years-long underfunding means those who can afford treatment are able to fund private sessions, despite the pandemic having a disproportionate impact on children living in poverty. Nearly 20 per cent of teenagers self harm, a rate that was rising along with depression and anxiety. But all services had “serious” vacancies, which meant longer wait times for even the most severe cases, whose conditions would worsen the longer they wait treatment from services under “enormous pressure” for the past five years. There were only 46 accredited fellow and 23 overseas-trained psychiatrists in the country. READ MORE:

 Chris Skelton/StuffMental Health Foundation chief executive Shaun Robinson says mental health services are under “immense pressure”. Meanwhile, parental drug and alcohol use was increasing. ""Everything responsible for distress in teenagers is up,” Wright said. “Now is the worst it’s ever been but I suspect we have the worst to come. I think we are seriously in trouble with no solutions.” In Wellington, 8.3 out of 20.4 fulltime equivalent clinical roles were empty, while in Taranaki, six of 20 roles were empty. Canterbury was short 7.2 full time equivalent nursing, 3.6 senior doctors and 2.9 allied health staff. Other boards were contacted but unable to respond in time. The shortage is leaving the sector at crisis point, while the Labour Government’s $1.9 billion investment in mental health over four years doesn’t go far enough to meet the deficit left by long-term underfunding as found in 2017’s He Ara Oranga inquiry, Mental Health Foundation chief executive Shaun Robinson said.

 “Certainly the National-led Government did an appalling job on it. But quite frankly no political party comes off looking great. It’s been underresourced, underscoped and ignored for decades.” Wellington father Matt spent up to $120,000 on private mental health support for his three teenage children who were abused by their mother. They have sought treatment through the public health system for severe anxiety since 2016, and his two daughters – who have gone through seven psychiatrists between them in 18 months– are back on Capital & Coast District Health Board’s children and adolescent mental health waiting list. Stuff has agreed not to identify him to protect his children’s identities. “I’m not looking for sympathy; I want to put it out there that the system is so broken, from someone who has struggled to get in the system,” he said. “I have the means to go into debt. What happens to the families that don’t?” Capital & Coast DHB’s mental health, addiction and intellectual disability service executive director, Karla Bergquist,​ said demand for child and youth mental health services was higher than before the pandemic, with longer wait times. It was recruiting nationally and internationally to fill roles for the service which also covers Hutt Valley and Wairarapa.

 But National Party deputy leader Nicola Willis said the Government needed to move quickly to ensure children and young people got the support they need. “I think it’s really disappointing that despite the Government’s significant promises in this area and the billions of dollars that have been committed, that children and young people still aren’t able to get the services,” she said.  Health Minister Andrew Little said there were acute workforce issues across the health system, while part of the $1.9b went towards workforce development. “At the senior clinician end, that’s an area with a world-wide shortage,” he said. “Creating a psychologist or clinical psychiatrists is a seven to 10-year plan.""",1661240495-262,https://www.stuff.co.nz/searchresults?q=covid+AND+mental+health,Doctor fears new mental health crisis for children and young people ...,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/128115939/doctor-fears-new-mental-health-crisis-for-children-and-young-people-looms-worsened-by-covid
"Kiwis are turning to online therapies as demand for mental health services continues to climb, but experts warn such supports are a stopgap only.","07:47, Nov 05 2021","Kiwis are turning to online therapies as demand for mental health services continues to climb, but experts warn such supports are a stopgap only. The uptake of virtual counselling and online therapy tools had spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic, with mental health platform Clearhead triaging 500 people an hour at peak times. Founder and chief executive Dr Angela Lim said in non-lockdown periods, the free service only had about 1000 users a month. “In the public system you have to jump through a few hoops, you have to be severe enough to qualify for funded therapy. With our service if you want help then that is the only criteria. READ MORE:

 * One year since lockdown: How are you feeling?
  “With the current public system people wait up to four months to see a councillor, however on Clearhead’s system it was less than a week.’’ While the digital tool was free, in-person or online therapy cost on average $120 an hour. Lim said she hoped to work with the Ministry of Health to make the service accessible to all Kiwis. “The problem is the ministry wouldn’t work with us, even when we show them these outcomes.” Ninety-five per cent of Clearhead’s service users reported improved self-awareness, and 80 per cent reported improved depression and anxiety symptoms, Lim said.SuppliedAngela Lim​, founder of digital employee health platform, Clearhead, says quiet quitting is a symptom of employers not understanding the needs of their younger workers. “That for me is the hardest thing – to have dramatically improved outcomes and just not be able to work with the ministry in any way.” A Ministry of Health spokesperson said the ministry has recently sought proposals from operators of digital mental health tools. The process was ongoing and the ministry expected to make an announcement later in the year. “Digital tools are not funded as an alternative to specialist mental health services, they are part of the broad spectrum of supports and services needed to address the mental health and wellbeing needs of New Zealanders,” they said.SuppliedAnna Elders is the clinical lead of Just a Thought, an online mental health tool with more than 30,000 members.  Anna Elders, clinical lead of Just a Thought, an online mental health tool with more than 30,000 members, said the site had a 196 per cent increase in visitors coming out of the August lockdown, equating to 24,656 website visits. There was also a 918 per cent increase in course registrations for the website’s short course ‘Staying on Track’, developed specifically to help with Covid-19 related stress. Elders said the huge jump indicated New Zealanders were experiencing higher levels of distress. “A lot of people struggle to gain the face-to-face support needed because of the range of hurdles to get into service – this is where digital comes in.” Elders said online options were not always a replacement for face-to-face treatment, but the site could offer increased choice and flexibility. “Our tools are just part of the toolbox of help people can seek,” she said.SuppliedOutLine general manager Claire Black says online therapy and digital tools don't work for everyone experiencing mental health issues. OutLine, an all-ages rainbow mental health organisation, saw its service use triple since last year’s national lockdown. General manager Claire Black said while online therapy platforms increased accessibility, they were only one piece of a much bigger puzzle. “Remote doesn’t work for everyone.” There were many structural components to mental health that could not be solved by online therapy alone, she said. “There is absolutely a shortage of mental health care, and high demand across the mental health sector is making it harder to get access.” Where to get help   1737, Need to talk?

"National health spokesman Shane Reti says he asked for an article he had written to be removed from the NZ Herald and Northern Advocate websites, so he could take another look at the data.","14:46, Mar 07 2022","National health spokesman Shane Reti says he asked for an article he had written to be removed from the NZ Herald and Northern Advocate websites, so he could take another look at the data. The article, published in print in the Advocate, said New Zealand should not have a “victory parade” over its low Covid-19 death toll yet because the effect of lockdowns on mental health was not yet clear. He then provided two graphs showing hospital admissions for self-harm, which the article said were provided by Health Minister Andrew Little. “The following graphs require further data analysis but seem to point to a story of generally increasing intentional self-harm,” Reti wrote. READ MORE:
 * New Zealand's time for global reconnection has arrived
 * Covid-19 NZ: Do border and MIQ settings make sense as Omicron spreads?
  The two graphs had straight lines over different time periods with different vertical axes, something that is generally avoided as it makes things harder to compare. The trend lines also travelled in a straight direction between the months chosen as start and end points, despite wide monthly variance in the data. The graphs came under attack on Twitter, and were changed several times on the web story. The University of Otago’s Dr Lucy Telfar Barnard replied to say that there were “serious flaws” in his data analysis and inferences. NZ Herald data journalist Keith Ng also criticised the graphs. Newsroom’s Marc Daalder unearthed a written Parliamentary question, which he assumed to be the source of the data in the story, which showed the average monthly hospitalisation rate for self-harm had actually dropped after March 2020.Christel Yardley/StuffThere has been much political strife over the effects of lockdown. That data showed the number of hospitalisations from self-harm actually dropped from 11,224 in the year to March 2020, to 11,079 in the year to March 2022. But Reti told Stuff his graphs were actually based on a separate Official Information Act (OIA) request which had slightly different data. “What’s fascinating is that everyone assumes the dataset is my Written Parliamentary Question, I didn’t want to feed the hysteria by commenting on it,” Reti said. He defended the article, nothing that he had said “further data analysis” was needed in the text of the piece. Reti said he suggested to the Northern Advocate that the article be removed while he had another look at the data, given the backlash. “Maybe we should just bring it down for the moment and recheck it, and re-look at it,” Reti said. Reti said he would forward on the OIA request to Stuff to see. “If you look at the OIA data the claim is valid. The most important point is to explore areas of concern where we need to focus our attention.” Reti said he had not considered modifying the data, so it was proportional to the population increase over the years covered.

 Ng said on Twitter that “story had been pulled” and thanked readers for the “spanking” over the graphs within it. “My understanding is that the lines were best-fit lines produced by linear regression and provided to NZME. They should not have been presented as real data,” Ng said. “It looks to be a poor fit and weak evidence for the contention that ‘self harm hospitalisation have been increasing over time since the first lockdown’. Nor is ‘increasing over time since the first lockdown’ a useful hypothesis, since it has not actually increased on the whole.” Many of those opposed to the Covid-19 response have alleged that there has been a rise in suicides as a result of lockdowns. Interim coronial data suggests that suicides actually dropped in 2020. The Northern Advocate have been asked if the article will be re-uploaded.

"A new report warns of a mental health tsunami in the wake of Covid-19, with the number needing support tipped to double.","17:44, Jun 13 2020","A new report warns of a mental health tsunami in the wake of Covid-19, with the number needing support tipped to double. The report by mental health experts at Koi Tū: The Centre for Informed Futures says up to 40 per cent of the population or two in five Kiwis could be adversely affected by the effects of the global pandemic ""for a period of time"". The group urged the Government to act quickly to prevent ""avoidable psychological damage and suffering"". Associate member of Koi Tū  and co-author Professor Richie Poulton from Otago University said Covid-19 could have a devastating effect on large groups of newly at-risk children, adolescents, working-age adults, and older people facing major unplanned disruption in their lives.

  The second wave of mental health distress was expected to result from the economic downturn and an increase in unemployment of up to 10 per cent.  “The new at-risk group have no playbook for this scenario and could respond in unpredictable or even catastrophic ways,” Poulton said. Karel MirayagaMany newly at-risk people could experience psychological distress as a result of the economic downturn, a new report says. Māori and Pacific people were at higher risk of mental health harm as a result of Covid-19 due to already high levels of deprivation, co-author Professor Tracey McIntosh said. Despite the bleak outlook the report authors argue there could be a silver lining if the Government takes the opportunity to ""reset"" existing outdated services and move to ""adaptive and innovative approaches"". The paper pushes for faster implementation of key recommendations from the He Ara Oranga Mental Health and Addictions Inquiry report and an increased focus on promoting wellbeing at a community level.  Most important was the need to address the causes of mental ill-health by improving access to the wider ""social determinants of wellbeing"" – health and educational services, economic opportunities, good food, heating and healthy housing.

 ""Building a better mental health response will mean next to nothing, and will be a poor investment, unless these issues are addressed at the same time. Otherwise, all we are building is a better conveyor belt to patch people up and send them out into the same problematic environment that caused them to seek help in the first place."" Koi Tū director Sir Peter Gluckman urged the Government to learn from previous experiences and prepare early to prevent psycholgical harm. “Based on what we have seen previously, for example after the Christchurch earthquakes and from overseas disaster experiences, we must prepare for increasing levels of disillusionment and despair in the months ahead, as the true impact and magnitude of Covid-19 takes hold,” he said. The group recommended the following be acted on with urgency in the next six months: meeting of basic human needs such as food, shelter, adequate income; promoting e-based psychological support; collection of accurate data on mental health needs; accelerating the roll-out of community-based mental health and addiction services and making employment support available as part of community mental health services. The Ministry of Health was already working on many of the recommendations, deputy director general for mental health and addiction Robyn Shearer said. Contracts for $40m of free community based services at GP clinics to be rolled out over the next 18 months were announced last month. When fully implemented, 350 health improvement practitioners and coaches would be working in more than 130 clinics around the country. The Ministry has released a psychosocial and mental wellbeing plan for the post-Covid recovery which provided a ""framework for collective actions to support whānau and communities to adapt and thrive over the next 12 to 18 months"" Shearer said.  It is seeking feedback on the plan until June 15, 2020.",1661240528-265,https://www.stuff.co.nz/searchresults?q=covid+AND+mental+health,"Mental health needs set to double in wake of Covid-19, report says ...",https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/121820288/mental-health-needs-set-to-double-in-wake-of-covid19-report-says

     Wooff said the nationwide month-long lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus was a stressful time for everyone. Some people would be experiencing anxiety for the first time, while for others with existing mental health issues the health crisis would be an added stress, which along with isolation could feel overwhelming. Even going to the supermarket, one of the few places people are allowed to visit during lockdown, could be anxiety-inducing as the atmosphere was tense and people were no longer talking to each other there, she said.SUPPLIED Dr Kirsten Wooff is a clinical psychologist based in Ponsonby, Auckland. Wooff and other mental health professionals are continuing to work during the lockdown, meeting with clients over Skype. ""Overall I want people to know it's OK to not be OK. I think that it's important that people can get some help if they need to,"" she said. ​Wooff, who runs Ponsonby-based Resilience Psychology and lives locally, said Ponsonby Rd was usually buzzing with activity but had been eerily quiet on Sunday.


    
   She hoped her messages on the pavement would bring some colour and life back to the street. Wooff planned to add to the messages during her daily walks around the neighbourhood. She expected the demand for mental health services to increase during the lockdown and in the weeks afterward. ""People might be in survival mode at the moment. It's easy to forget this stuff in the midst of other stress.""
