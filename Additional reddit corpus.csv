Like I said. Combined covid and suicide deaths in Aus is less than covid deaths in Sweden. You can’t dispute that lmao 

Go away troll. If you really cared about mental health you would be demanding the liberals to front up about Centrelink robodebt, you’d be increasing welfare, you’d be increasing medical access to mental health treatments, you’d be increasing funding to crisis support.

I did try to get in to the pain clinic a few years ago but because I was able to get myself to hydrotherapy once a week they decided I wasn't that bad and discharged me after the initial consult. I should try again though.

After many years I did manage to find a great GP and they were incredibly helpful, but everything stopped in March and they moved to a hospital setting during COVID, and haven't come back to general practice. So I have to find someone new, which, as someone with chronic pain AND mental health history, is rather difficult.

If you have any secret method to finding a good GP please share! I've prepared so many questions it feels like holding job interviews!"

This report makes six recommendations, among them, a requirement that the Australian Government report to the Australian Parliament no later than 1 December 2020 on the progress of their implementation. The report identifies four areas for immediate action to support the aged care sector:


First, the Australian Government should fund providers to ensure there are adequate staff available to deal with external visitors to enable a greater number of more meaningful visits between people receiving care and their loved ones.
Second, the Australian Government should create Medicare Benefits Schedule items to increase the provision of allied health and mental health services to people living in residential aged care during the pandemic to prevent deterioration in their physical and mental health.
Third, the Australian Government should publish a national aged care plan for COVID-19 and establish a national aged care advisory body.
Finally, the Australian Government should require providers to appoint infection control officers and should arrange for the deployment of accredited infection prevention and control experts into residential aged care homes.



Summary above - bolding is the commission's emphasis not mine.




""Australian Government report to the Australian Parliament no later than 1 December 2020 on the progress of their implementation""


Looks like they really don't trust them to do anything, do they? A two month deadline.

You will get doom and gloom answers on here though, this subreddit can be quite negative at times. 

In regards to what we could do better, I think we need a little more community in some areas. Working bees, clean ups, tree planting, sport and social clubs. These give people a sense of belonging and bring us closer to each other. They're things that may seem like a chore but once you're there they are great.

In my opinion hobbies, events and groups are dying off in favour of people staying home or going shopping. I believe much of our mental health problems are partially caused by a lack of belonging, not overcoming hardship as a group and social isolation. But I'm no psychologist so take my thoughts with a grain of salt.

Note: staying home is wise during COVID! My answer is more directed at pre covid life, but I'm sure it will be relevant again."

God. YES.

I argue that till I'm blue in the face because so many people are still convinced this is a fact. You're more likely to have to pay a gap than get bulk billed sessions, and with clinical psychs in my experience you get what you pay for. The good ones are $$$$$. And 10 sessions is nowhere near enough for someone with a severe, chronic or complex mental health issue. Not even remotely enough.

The inquiry spoke of health and welfare primarily in terms of mental health. Vitally important certainly, but not the key objective.  It spoke of best practices in terms of an aggregate of Australian systems and pre-identified risks.

The closest we get to any actual science is the quarantine period and a 2 page explainer on COVID-19 in the attachments.

We’ve no actual science to the hotel quarantine environment, its procedures or its limits. We’re operating it like a cargo cult and hoping it works, with the only “controlled” property of the virus being its incubation time.

Things like the spread through SA quarantine via ventilation were “surprising”. Things like Victoria’s Hotel Quarantine seeding more secondary cases than simply sending home the Ruby Princess cohort are assumed to be a failure of best practices. Transmission within high density public housing towers with even greater restrictions on residents than in HQ are presumed to not be relevant. We have no means of assessing these new variant’s impact on the effectiveness of our quarantine beyond a “suck it and see” approach.

One thing that a lot of people seems to be ignoring is that this virus is new and the way it spreads, the long term effects, and the way it affects different aspects of the population is still largely unknown. The government has had to swing it blind with their actions and mostly down well. 

I also want to make a point that several of the things you discuss have actually nothing to do with Covid and was going to happen anyway, although Covid has probably enhanced or speed them up. The economy was already heading into recession. Do not let the government blame Covid. It's bullshit. Housing affordability has already been an issue and the Liberal government is responsible for gutting the mental health system. So while I agree that Covid has shone a spotlight on these areas, it is not the fault. These were already issues. I'm more worried with the government misplacing the blame on Covid19 and the public falling for it."

Their minimum wage alone is $35 AUD. This is Switzerland, Australia could easily implement this but we don't, they don't think about these things or creating strategies beneficial to the economy and to every single citizen of the country. 

Compared to so many other countries, we're failing when it comes to the cost of living and our wages, they do not match up which causes a lot of the problems with the lower and middle classes of this country. We do not earn enough and when we do it as at a detrimental cost to work-life balance and mental health. That is not a future worth anything. 

Even then, employers are so unregulated here that half the time they don't even listen to the law and still underpay the minimum wage and find ways to abuse loopholes so that nobody gets enough hours (or even too much hours but with a poor wage) to earn enough to rival their welfare significantly anyways. And about welfare...yeah...our system is deemed one of the worst in the world, even Israel far surpasses it (hell Israel surpasses the UK's and America's.) We are so far behind so many first world countries it's a complete mind-fuck. 

We need lower cost of living, but historically, it will continue rising. So to match it, we need proper wages, substantial, meaningful increases and a welfare system that removes homelessness properly and is actually survivable to live on. We need tax cuts for the poor, higher taxes for the wealthy and nobody dodging their tax with corrupt loopholes, everyone who has to pay tax, will pay their way, that's equality for you. We need employers held accountable for trying to find systemic loopholes and enforce them to actually hire people with proper contracts and dedicated shifts, hours, etc. Proper training incentives and for citizens of this country, like Finland, Greece, Germany, Spain, etc, Universal Healthcare and Free University, as is the right of citizens to have access to proper quality education and equal rights to health, as quality of life is our right. 

This can all be done with intellectuals behind the wheel implementing a new cycle that will ultimately create a beneficial economic upturn and a country with genuinely happy citizens who are free, who are wealthy, who are more equal than divided by class and social status, who have paths open to them to pursue what they want to do and have the self-empowerment to build a future for themselves, where there is no poverty, no divide, no oppression, no desperation. Australia would truly be a leading nation of the first world if we could achieve this and we do have the willpower to do so however we are chained by a Government so selfish and corrupt that they will do anything, even buy out the media and manipulate the easily manipulated, to keep themselves wealthy, keep themselves in control, to keep this same broken cycle we've been living in for years and years now that is slowly rotting away this country, they want no change, no progress, nothing. 

They're fine keeping things as they are. It is the deliberate and intentional hindrance of a worthy future that is what angers me and I can't stand it. We have options, paths, but they wish to just stay in the past and let us rot. They hold our generation back and destroy the previous ones minds with their pathetic ideologies and warped dreams of the ""good old days,"" dangling the deteriorated carrot of keeping things safe by keeping them in the cycle they know and understand, everything else is dangerous and laughable, they don't learn, they don't understand, they're being taught not to so they can keep believing they're safe and in control, no, they lost all the control and are now puppets dancing on a string, brain-dead and they don't even know it. 

Murdoch and the Goverment owns their asses, completely and utterly, they refuse to listen to us so we have to take action ourselves to get shit done because they're disappointments who have failed us repeatedly and let us down. We can accomplish so much more but we have to claw and fight our way into positions of power to oust these fuckers out of their cozy nests and set their bubbles on fire to remind them that we don't want to reside in the 70's anymore, we want the future, we want the promise, we want to find our own way, our own path, with our own beliefs and ideas, with our own power.

Ridiculously stupid restrictions are still in place like only one parent is allowed into the hospital per child for emergency or any medical appointment.

Another thing you could measure is mental health. Whilst suicide rates may not be up, I'll bet you two cents that mental health diagnoses/ treatment have skyrocketed. I don't know where you'd locate this information but if you can find Medicare billing for ""Better Access to Mental Health Care Plans"" (MBS Item Number 2715 and 2717) there'd be a massive spike compared to pre-COVID years.

The only other thing I'd like to mention is that a bigger problem than the undiagnosed cancers and disease, currently being missed due to healthcare avoidance, could be the result of poorer lifestyle options during COVID-19 - such as higher alcohol use, less exercise, unhealthy dietary choices and weight gain. It's possible that we'll be facing decades of higher rates of chronic disease as a result of poor habits triggered by the COVID-19 lock-downs and social distancing."

Using the raw numbers when the populations are so dissimilar is dishonest, and a clear attempt to create unnecessary fear. Of course the US also has lockdowns in almost every state. Some of the leading states for death count are California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which are all among the strictest states for lockdowns, so you're really not making the case for lockdowns that you think you are, you're just showing that deaths still occur under lockdowns.

  A better country to look at to see what happens if you don't lock down would be Sweden, which has had a total 7893 COVID deaths (around 20,000 adjusted for Australia's population). Now that doesn't sound great, but it's not the right figure to look at. You're better off looking at excess mortality, which is how many people are dying who weren't going to die anyway. Sweden's total all-cause deaths for this year is below the long-term average, which means that there are, in fact, less people dying than normally would. In other words, statistically, everyone dying there of COVID was an expected death, that is to say that they were most likely going to die this year anyway. That shouldn't come as a surprise when we know COVID almost exclusively kills very old and sick people, but it's something that apparently needs to be spelled out in the world we now live in.

  So no more people in Sweden are dying than normal, which in a supposedly catastrophic pandemic is clearly a success story, and Sweden has achieved this without trampling on the basic human rights of its citizens. It has avoided the mental health disaster and attendant sky-rocketing deaths of despair and addiction that locked-down countries are facing (the leading cause of excess deaths amongst US 25-44 year olds this year is opioid overdose, not COVID). It hasn't destroyed the education of a generation of its children. It hasn't presided over the greatest transfer of wealth from the working class to the very rich in its history. Unfortunately, thanks to the globalised world we live in, it hasn't avoided the economic damage that the idiocy of most countries has wrought, but its economy is performing a lot better than other Western nations.

  By no measure are lockdowns a success, and even if they were, that wouldn't justify the human rights abuses they entail, and they wouldn't justify the lurch into right-wing authoritarianism."

I find this surprising as I think I've made them very clear, and they should be very obvious, but let me list them out and try and source those that I can (although not all can be sourced for reasons that I will set out):

Measurable and somewhat measurable things


Lockdowns cause much greater mental health issues than other policy decisions. Fairly bloody obvious why, humans are social creatures that are not designed to be isolated from family and friends for massive periods of time, in dark houses or flats not designed to be lived in 24/7, often with no access to nature, with no end in sight. Melbourne and Vic are having a mental health crisis, hospital admissions for young: ""In early August, a week into stage 4 lockdown, the Victorian Government  revealed there'd been a 33 per cent increase in young people presenting  to emergency departments because of intentional self-harm, compared to the same time in 2019"" Even worse, these experts say that repeat lockdowns are much worse than the first in mental health outcomes. Perhaps you're ok with this, I'm not.
Lockdowns cause an increase in domestic violence. Practioners everywhere are petrified about this. Next time some idiot says ""oh so you want to kill grandmas"", reply to them ""oh you want to hurt and kill women"". There are no choices here that don't have big impacts on lives and quality of life. It's really hard to get the real stats on this of course because the number of cases is likely to be impacted by how much harder it is for abusers to access services when they are around their abusers 24/7, but absolutely every expert on this expects horrible stats and the UK stats were shocking. ""Two-thirds of women in abusive relationships have suffered more violence  from their partners during the pandemic, according to an investigation  by the BBC’s Panorama."" The UN expects a 25% increase in incidents, injuries and deaths. Perhaps you're ok with this, I'm not.
The impacts of lockdowns are much worse on disadvantaged people and families, who have even less access to support than they normally do, and are forced into worse accomodation, with worse food, often with more people and in jobs that are less likely to be able to be done from home. Perhaps you're ok with this, I'm not.
Lockdowns absolutely fuck with students. UNESCO says they cause interruped learning, poor nutrition, confusion and stress for teachers, stress for parents, rises in dropouts, increased exposure to violence, high economic costs, social isolation etc etc. I think we'll look back on what we did to students as terrible. Once again, the impacts are much worse for poor and disadvantaged students. And of course closing schools causes awful mental health issues for students:  ""In a survey by the mental health charity YoungMinds, which included 2111 participants up to age 25 years with a mental illness history in the UK, 83% said the pandemic had made their conditions worse. "" Perhaps you're ok with this, I'm not.
Lockdowns increase obesity, associated with worse long term outcomes and also of course, associated with worse covid outcomes (it's the worst indicator of covid issues in people under 64 years old and increases your chance of death by 48%). Once again this is worst in disadvantaged families and communities, and worst of all in children. Aus if of course one of the most obese nations in the world. Perhaps you're ok with this, I'm not.
Lockdowns are worse for a whole range of other specific conditions, for example people with eating disorders. ""The results suggest that disruptions to daily life as a result of lockdown and social distancing may have a detrimental impact on an individual’s wellbeing, with almost nine out of ten (87%) of  participants reporting that their symptoms had worsened as a result of  the pandemic. Over 30% stated that their symptoms were much worse."" Perhaps you're ok with this, I'm not.
Lockdown is horrible for relationships. Humans are not supposed to spend that amount of time with only each other, and when you combine that with the mental health and other issues I've outlined lockdown resulted in divorces and relationship breakdowns that otherwise wouldn't have been the case. ""A study on the impacts of Covid-19  by Relationships Australia, the leading national provider of  relationship support services, found that 42% of people had experienced a  negative change in their relationship with their partner during the  last few months."" The numbers of people thinking about divorce have tripled. That's many thousands of real life relationships made toxic by our decision to lock down. Maybe you're ok with it, I'm not."

When you were born, you had life expectancy of about 65 years if you were male and 70 years if you were female Life expectancy table.

When you were 17 years old in 1957 and about to start your adulthood, the world experiences a horrible pandemic. This pandemic, known as the Asian flu pandemic as it originated in China, kills 2 million people worldwide, which adjusted for today's population would be around 5 million people killed today. Yes, 5 million. This was a horrible flu, which according to our health department ""was concentrated in school-children and the second in the elderly. Infants and the elderly were more likely to die."" It had an infection mortality rate of c. 0.3%.

As horrible as this pandemic was, and although it was very much spread by young people like yourself, neither Australia nor the world require you to sacrifice your youth or your prospects to shut down, although there were various minor restrictions. Elimination was not suggested let alone attempted. Fortunately a somewhat effective vaccine was developed and this coupled with herd immunity and improved treatment options resulted in the gradual subsiding of the pandemic. 

That is until 1968 when the same flu mutated into the Hong Kong flu, so called because it originated in Hong Kong, which was not part of China until it was effectively annexed this year whilst we were distracted by covid, but I digress. In 1968 you were aged 28 and very much in the prime of your life, during one of the most incredible times in modern history. This flu killed 1m people (other sources say up to 4m), which adjusted for world population today is the equivalent of 2m people. It affected mainly the elderly and may well have killed your grandparents. You weren't in an age group affected however, partly because scientists speculate you developed an immunity to this kind of virus when you got the similar 1957 variant.

Still, despite it's impact on the elderly at the time, there was no global lockdown. Indeed you were welcome to participate in the most culturally impactful years of the 20th century in terms of music, art, politics, social justice, drugs, you name it. Elimination was again not suggested let alone attempted. Indeed this particular 1968 virus still exists today.

A few years later when you give up your fantastic and fulfilling young life and knuckle down in the workforce, you get to experience the most incredible wage growth ever seen in this country, with REAL (adjusted for inflation) incomes rising by c. 40% from 1970 through to 1980, the most important years of your economic life. And house prices? They grow, but they they grow completely in step with incomes.

This meant you could move out of home and you could have kids. Things weren't all rosy of course, the Cold War and threat of nuclear destruction loom, but still society and the economy kept on ticking and you were able to raise your kids with a better standard than you'd experienced. You also had a very small chance of being conscripted for Vietnam.

By the time you were 60 and nearing retirement it was 2,000 and any savings or investments were about to EXPLODE, thanks to the double whammy of a crazy stock prices and of course, house prices, which were about to start growing massively greater than wage growth, benefiting people just like you who had bought multiple properties with your growing incomes.

And it gets better, because the government started to actually favour your newfound capital gains with tax policy: Or as the Grattan Institute put it PRE-COVID ""Governments supercharged these demographic pressures by introducing generous tax concessions for older people. The share of households over 65 paying tax has halved over the past two decades. And average income tax paid has barely changed for people over 65 despite strong growth in their incomes and wealth. Working-age Australians are underwriting the living standards of older Australians to a much greater extent than the Baby Boomers did for their forebears, straining the ‘generational bargain’ to breaking point. Indeed just from 1986 to 2016 the average wealth of your now older household grew from 2.5x an average younger household, to almost 4x. In just 20 years.

And then in March 2020 something not so unprecedented happens. The world experiences another pandemic when you are 80 years old, just like you did when you were 17 years old and 28 years old. This is more scary now, because at 80 years old you are close to the median age of covid death in Australia which is 82. Daunting, but perhaps less so in comparison to your life expectancy at birth of about 67.5 years, which at this point you have outperformed by 12.5 years. And MUCH less daunting when put into comparison to the life expectancy of an Australian child born TODAY, which is 82.5.

This new disease has an infection fatality ratio of between 0.3-0.5% and has almost killed 1m people globally. Like the pandemics you lived through when you were younger, this pandemic dominantly (in fact even more so) kills the elderly.

But what's different this time? A few things. This time the world does something completely different to handle this virus. Although pandemics are (as demonstrated), not even remotely unprecedented, the world's response to this one very much is. THIS TIME, the world asks the young to put their lives and living on hold, indefinitely, For your benefit. Schools are shut down, live music and culture is effectively cancelled, relationships are postponed or cut off, borders are closed.

You're not even ASKED for your viewpoint on this, indeed you might disagree with this approach. You might be concerned about the absolutely unprecedented impact on youth and young adult mental health, life satisfaction, education, employment prospects. You might look at your grandchildren who have had what limited employment prospects which remained lit on fire. Who ALREADY were living at home in record numbers due to the cost of housing. Who ALREADY have the worst mental health in decades. Who ALREADY had had their lives attacked and restricted through government policies like lock-outs.

Put simply, you have enjoyed an incredible life during an incredible time, and you might not require or prefer your world, your country, your state to change the way it deals with health emergencies, pandemics and risk in a most unprecedented way in the hope of getting you a few more years. And on the off chance that you DO want this, perhaps you should reflect on your own life."

Victoria’s roadmap out of lockdown is the wrong approach. Here’s what good public policy looks like

So where is the alternative plan? Despite the heading it is not to found in this article.

All of the following is being done in Victoria.

As a result, they have sought to switch their emphasis away from sweeping lockdowns in favour of intensive testing, contact tracing and helping people to self-isolate  with financial assistance, if required.

Victoria is doing intensive testing, it has got its contact tracing up to what Morrison claims is “gold standard”. It is deploying regional contact tracing teams, upgrading its contact tracing software and deploying AI software from IBM to help with advanced case linking.

It has been offering money for people to self isolate before and after for months.

e.g.  https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/covid-19-worker-support-payment

Funds have also been made available for mental health support 

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-09/coronavirus-crisis-hitting-mental-health-of-victorians-hard/12539152

And small business assistance is being provided with more on the way

Businesses within metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire that are affected by the new Stage 4 restrictions from 2 August may be eligible for a one-off, $10,000 grant under the Business Support Fund

https://global.vic.gov.au/whatson/2020/september-2020/responding-to-coronavirus-covid19/summary-of-government-assistance-to-businesses-accessible

Apparently we should be copying Europe. I don’t think so.

https://theconversation.com/how-worried-should-we-be-about-the-coronavirus-resurgence-in-europe-three-experts-weigh-in-143858

I would be happy to read an article that provided some evidence based arguments as to why the lockdown targets should be lower but this is not it."

I'm just an internet nobody who cares deeply about Australia and Australians even though we might differ on what that means,

I think some of you may need to ask yourselves the question ""What information or argument would make me change my mind?"" on some of this stuff, certainly on Victoria's strategy, maybe on elimination and maybe even on lockdown. Even if you're the most ardent lockdowner, or Andrews supporter, or Labour voter, or whatever your inclinations are, just ponder the question ""what would be my personal line for anti-covid measures?""

Many seem to think it's just the 5g anti mask scamdemic types who are ideological. But it's not. Many people have a tendency towards centralised government technocratic policy, and also many of you are content to think that this sort policy must be the best policy (sometimes it is). Or maybe you have a tendency to agree with it because it comes from the Andrews Victorian government, and you like the Andrews Victorian government (I like various aspects of it too).

If your argument is falsifiable, as in there is literally no new information or turn of events that could cause you to change your view, then you don't have an opinion, you have a faith. And faith is very dangerous, whether it's faith that Covid is an illumanati scam to control the population, or faith that our governments could never do wrong. I get that it might be hard, and against every part of you (very understandably) to change your opinion to something that you feel is what the Murdoch press (who are a bunch of cunts, let's be clear) are saying. But just because you like a certain party or tend towards a certain ideology doesn't mean that party or ideology can't be responsible for some godawful policy. And just because you feel that this has gone too far doesn't make you far right scum. You can still be a green, Murdoch hating, passionate lefty with a general faith in subject matter experts, who thinks we've gone too far on Covid. You're still you, it's not some sort of betrayal. And let's be honest, this is now beyond a partisan issue. There are plenty of racist rural Hanson voting types who agree with you on border closures, and on quarantine, and on the police enforcing this. It's well beyond party in Aus.

I don't want to convince you that I'm right, indeed I really hope that I'm not right. I genuinely hope that I'm wrong. I hope that we get a vaccine any day now and that Australia will come out the other side of this performing much better than most other countries and with far fewer excess deaths. I genuinely take no identity or interest in being ""contrarian"" on this issue (I know that some do). I also genuinely appreciate that this virus is not the flu, that it's more deadly and that we need to be very aware about it and that our society won't return to ""normal"" for a long time. Like most of you I avoid confined spaces, I only eat outside, I wear a mask whenever on transport or in a shop, I also am ashamed to admit I cross the street or walk away when I hear a cough or a sniffle. And if I see an old person, I give them a wide berth, it seems like the right thing to do and the thought of inadvertently passing on Covid makes me shudder.

So again, I hope I'm wrong. But I'm very worried and frankly angry about the chance that I'm not wrong. I am extremely concerned about Victoria and the welfare of people who live there. I think VIC will never reach zero community transmission, and I don't think this is a radical perspective given where the rest of the world is at. I think we will get a vaccine in about 18 months that is somewhat effective, but not great, and many people will understandably not want to take a vaccine that they feel has been rushed through (although it will likely be some combination of already tested drugs). And so I think our approach will look crazy in hindsight, that it will genuinely be seen as the biggest ""own goal"" we've ever kicked as a country. I think that Europe and much of the rest of the world will learn to live with this virus and Aus will be crippled.

Not simply crippled economically (although it may well be), I'm more worried about the country and society itself being crippled. I'm worried about a population that's been torn apart by this virus. Just think about what Australia could look like if we got this approach all wrong: 


The public's faith in science and medicine will be fucked for decades. On every issue you'll hear ""oh but remember when they told us about covid..."" from an already often anti-science and anti-expert population
The country will get even more divided: States will remain stubbornly closed, families separated for enormous amounts of time, and people mentally fatigued when they finally see each other to the detriment of their relationships.
We'll have a population of young people who feel they had some of their ""best"" years fucked forever because of this. Years of life, love, relationships, youth all sacrificed for nothing.
We'll have far worsened one of the defining features of modern life: the loneliness epidemic. 
The generational divide, already worse than it's ever been, will get to crisis levels. The young who have been locked out of the property market, with stagnant or decreasing incomes, with massive youth unemployment, with horrible job prospects will only get angrier. The gap will become even larger, and it won't be fixed by inheritance if you're lucky enough to have one (the average age of inheritance in Australia is over 50...). And that's not even to mention to uproar it will cause when people work out who is going to pay for the incredible cost of this strategy.
We'll have a massive population of students who had their most formative years screwed up. Young people were already anxious, spending too much time indoors and on social media/gaming, and we're making it so much worse.
We'll have entire industries of people that never recover. The industries which we all love the most. Music, theatre, culture. Gone for years. That doesn't just come back!
Worst of all, we'll have made the crisis of mental health even worse. And it will hit the young, and young women in particular. It would genuinely be easier mentally to have a war going on than this. At least you would know there was an enemy and that they had to be defeated. But this is an enemy that by trying to win against you lose even more and for longer. I am so so sorry for Victorians, I think you have been set up for failure, a debilitating unnecessary failure."

In February of this year I moved to Sydney on a working holiday visa. On 17th of March I had to leave because of the pandemic and return to Ireland. I didn't want to leave Australia, it was primarily due to the economic uncertainty as well as the advice of both governments in response to Covid 19. Unfortunately it was the wrong thing to do. Since I came home it has been impossible to find any employment, I am back living with my parents who I am completely dependant upon. My mental health has drastically deteriorated.

I was told that I could apply for a waiver as my current visa is due to expire. Which is at least some relief. Unfortunately the only way I was told I could enter Australia is if I give a compelling reason and it is accepted. Also I would be required to Quarantine for 14 days, this costs around $3000 which is far too much for me to afford. I was hoping to immediately start farm (visa) work when re-entering, just so I am eligible for a second visa.

I don't know what to do or how I can get back. Can anyone give me some advice?, or has there been any information about when travel restrictions will be lifted?"

further, the public mental health professionals i've spoken to do not understand autism as a concept, and were shocked to learn about several common symptoms (hyperfixation, sensory sensitivity, etc.) in the course of our conversations, with one admitting, and no i am not making this up, that he expected sheldon cooper or greta thunberg-like behaviour to be the only real examples of the disorder. they were surprised to learn that there are a very common physiological biomarkers (amygdala formaton, often spinal fluid pressure). one even accused me of malingering because ""autism doesn't just not get diagnosed in childhood,"" even though no one knew what the fuck autism was in the 90s.

Currently I'm on month number 4?? Week 2 of hard lock down in Victoria. It's not fun. I haven't left the house really for weeks on end. It is tedious, and frustrating. 

But what is really driving the death rate in Victoria is this. Privately run for profit aged care homes, funded by federal liberal government, have put profit before people. They ran a system where they drove down the care in these aged homes, and neglected their charges. When COVID came along and highlighted just how few qualified nurses were in these homes and with the Army nursing medics coming in to expose how how neglectful these homes are. Scummo Morrison and his co-hort are either seeking to minimize their responsibility by highlighting cost, or are trying to blame the states for the broken system they perpetuated.

I do not support any government forcing people to stay inside for pretty much any reason


It's not a great thing to have to do, sure, I get that .. I've had two COVID-19 tests and had to stay quarantined until results (total of 8 days all up). I didn't like it, my partner didn't like it, my dog absolutely hated it .. but we would hate it all a hell of a lot more if I knew I had COVID-19, I went down the local park with my dog, happened to talk to/get too close to/touch something, then someone who then contracted it and died from it - also passing it onto to who knows how many others who may die from it. This one is coming from a fantastic place, it's ensuring the spread doesn't go further and it's literally savings lives.

I moved to Sydney right at the start of Covid so I could go to better Tafe courses and have more options, and try to find a job that's better for my disabilities (I did fast food at a corner store for just under 6 months, then cleaning for the same people after they had to close due to the fires and drought making orders too expensive and the work wiped me out for the rest of the week due to pain), also came down just to get more active and have stuff to do. Look how that turned out lol.

At least I'm studying again, I'm excited for that, but doing the online classes has been hard because my laptop karked it. I'm going to the nearby Tafe to use their computers at the moment, but my older sister lent me some money and I have a new laptop on the way! She's an angel. I wanna go see her and my aunt and visit the graveyard to see dad once covid is over and I have some time. 

I've also been seeing doctors and getting treatment and it's so much faster here, I'm already feeling so much better and it's improving my mental health. Its made me realise a lot of my mental health issues was related to my physical health and the people around me. Moving with my friend was super stressful but I've noticed that my depression, anxiety and other stuff isn't as bad as it used to be, even though I'm not medicated anymore. I'm looking at getting an adhd diagnosis too, I might get meds for that so I can focus and not get stuck in a feedback loop of you want to do the think but your brain won't let you, but I might not have to take anti depressants again which is good because I don't like the side effects.

Anyway, it's been mostly up for me even with covid! I'm worried that centrelink is going to stop covid payments after awhile but I'm enjoying the extra money, I'm actually able to get better quality stuff that doesn't just break after two uses. How's everyone else been?"

There is no maximum time. 

Risk to self includes risk of self bodily harm, but also risk to finances, risk to reputation, etc. Some people have mania episodes and come to their senses weeks later having destroyed their finances, relationships, employment, etc.

While you are admitted there will be regular reviews of your case. I know it sucks to be locked up, but the problem with mental illness is that your emotions and mental processes are not actually functioning properly. The psychiatrists have actually seen it all. When you are ready to take care of yourself they will let you out. Space in the hospital is limited, and they want you out as soon as possible. Just take a break and trust that your health is getting better. It can take a few weeks for the medication to have an effect. Read some books. Watch some shows. Start making plans for the coming years. Most people never get a chance to really plan their life. And try not to hook up with people in there - they have their own problems to deal with, and you want to move away from problems not invite more into your life.

Also now is not the time to try to move overseas. Besides the COVID situation, many other countries don't have the healthcare support that Australia has. Take your time and get things done right here before considering a move."

""We know a Covid vaccine will have a positive effect on obese people but we suspect from all our knowledge from tests on the Sars vaccine and the flu vaccine it will have a diminished benefit compared to the others”  As a reference for example, this study found that that flu vaccines were about half as effective in obese people. This is a more comprehensive review and includes some findings that various influenza vaccines produced little or sometimes worse outcomes in obese patients (yes I am very aware covid is not influenza, there is little out there on obesity and previous coronaviruses).

The Guardian article on the study also notes that a vaccine is also likely to be less effective for elderly people, as is the case with many flu vaccines. This is a well cited review that finds influenza vaccines in the elderly are about 25% effective, and at best ""the usefulness of vaccines in the elderly community is modest"". Even worse, consider this suggestion from two immunologists in the Conversation: ""People age 65 and over suffer the most severe cases of COVID-19 and have the highest associated mortality rate. If the goal is to have COVID-19 vaccines ready for public use by early 2021, the only  ones that have a chance are those that are currently in clinical trials. It is likely that most of these did not undergo pre-clinical optimization for an elderly population, meaning these first-generation  COVID-19 vaccines may perform poorly in the people that need them most.""

Consider the implications if a potential vaccine (which we hope to have but don't have) isn't very effective for the two main and very dominant risk factors for covid: old age (the median covid death in Australia is 84 years old) and obesity. There is a close third risk factor: being male, although I understand there is limited chance of a cure for this one despite some high hopes...

To add insult to injury, the side effects of our current chosen policy will be felt most keenly and sustained by groups that are less susceptible to covid in the first place. Including young adults (particularly young women who experience even worse mental health problems but are even less likely to have bad covid outcomes), school children and women in abusive relationships.

This would suggest we and many other countries may have our lockdown and suppression policy dangerously wrong. Alternative policy might look something like this:


We should be focused on investing in our societies to help minimise risk for the elderly (eg massive aged care investment in staff, safety and procedures, this would tie in nicely with the horrible findings of the royal commission),
We should focus on public health (sugar tax, ban on various fast food advertising, additional health education, perhaps subsidisation of healthy food for more vulnerable people etc).
We should keep much of social distancing for as long as is required, but allow society to function closer to pre-covid than is the case now.
Where there are breakouts that threaten to overwhelm health systems they should be more localised and focused on shielding the vulnerable (those most likely to require hospital admission) rather than VIC style sledgehammers.


If we pursued such policies, and a vaccine/s arrived within a couple of years then we will have a healthier society where we can completely remove social distancing. However if we don't get a vaccine, or it's much less effective than hoped, or as expected it's not effective for the people most likely to die, then I think that alternative policy is the only hope. I know it's very controversial, but I think once you think through the different outcomes, there aren't really alternatives.

Perhaps some of these findings turn out to be wrong or overstated, but boy oh boy do we need more debate about where we are headed. I really worry we are going to look back on this in 5 to 10 years and be shocked with the decisions that were made.

Again, I appreciate that what I say here is currently highly controversial, really happy to accept challenge but it would be good to see a bit less instant downvoting and a bit more discussion.

tl;dr The expectation is that any covid vaccine we get is likely to be much less effective for the obese and elderly, the two most dominant risk factors for covid death and hospitalisation. Hence under the existing policy approach we may rip society to shreds whilst we wait in hope for a vaccine, which won't work on those that need it most."

Almost all studies and comments from big lockdown supporters fail to take into consideration the general shitness of lockdown and border closures for so many people. Whilst you can have a daily ticker of infections and deaths, you can't have a daily ticker of things like the following:


Funerals missed
Sick and dying family members you couldn't be around because you couldn't get there
People giving birth you couldn't be around, or babies or children you couldn't visit
Friendships lost or worsened because you can't see each other
Relationships that are delayed or can't start because people can't see each other (technology is a poor substitute)
People financially and emotionally wrecked by being kept in countries or states that they can't return from due to border closures
A cultural sector that has been absolutely fucking destroyed and will take many years to recover, if it ever does. A cultural sector that was already in difficult places in Australia
The massive creeping of authoritarianism in Australia. Some of you are way too blase about this, the second largest state in Vic has a fucking police enforced curfew, something that was never enforced in most of Europe. Aus is the only democracy in the world where you cannot leave at the moment without government permission, why do we just accept this shit? A lot of you just seem to think that liberty and privacy are things that can easily be switched on and off. But they're not, look at the massive far reaching consequences of 9/11 on privacy and liberty and whether they've been wound back (spoiler, most weren't).
The complete breakdown of Australian solidarity. The approach taken has set much of Australia against each other. The chastising of Victorians has been disgusting. The way each state is taking pot shots at each other and there's no national plan is pathetic. Most of the country has decided this is all the fault of travellers and returning citizens and is happy to curb their rights, effectively ban them from entering the country and make them pay for their own detention. The way that the news and this forum and many other forums and conversations are filled with stories of people dobbing in their neighbours or friends, or reporting people to the police, or just generally being obsessed with the minority of rule breakers, all kept up by a hysterical media is awful. Australia has reacted far worse in this respect than most countries. We're a nation founded on a history of convicts who have shown ourselves to be judgemental authoritarians.


You'll note I haven't mentioned a single ""economic"" cost. I do this intentionally. Firstly I find that many people (often younger people) see the economy perhaps understandably as something that doesn't benefit them anyway. I'm also of the view that it's really hard to compare the economic effects given we have a single democracy (Sweden) that didn't shut down schools or enforce lockdowns (although it strongly advised social distancing and working from home), and also because economic effects can only be measured over long time periods. But I think the economy is a bit of a distraction, life is about living and quality of life and I think lockdowns and the current border closures have been massively detrimental to life.

It's perplexing that expressing these sorts of opinions has become seen as kind of ""right wing"". Who would have thought that using Sweden as an example 12 months ago would be seen as being ""right wing""! Who would have thought that being concerned with mental health, with the general breakdown of social interaction, with the breakdown of solidarity, and with the impacts largely felt by children and disadvantaged communities would be seen as being right wing. We've successfully created a nice little environment where the only people willing to go on record in opposition to many of these policies are conservatives and free market types, even though there are many experts and people who are progressive out there with similar opinions. At a time where the decisions being made are the most influential ever on our lives, the level of debate and opposition and the general attitude to debate in Australia remains shocking. We've completely abdicated to state politicians and to certain epidemiologists and doctors (although of course the Swedish epidemiologists and doctors heading up their strategy don't count of course...).

And worst of all there is no roadmap out of this mess. Fast forward 3 to 6 months and what do you think will be the state of play? Unless we change tack I predict VIC will still have a level of infections just like every other place in the world that has an actual breakout. So QLD, WA and SA won't allow any Vics in because they have pursued elimination strategies and any change in this will be deeply unpopular. And we won't be able to change the international border situation of course for similar reasons. And any minor outbreak in any state will require a state based lockdown, school closures etc. Mental health will be absolutely fucked, we will have ruined the education of hundreds of thousands of school children and Australia will be more divided than it has ever been.

So they are the costs of lockdown. You like many people might have the opinion that the costs are worth the benefits, which is absolutely fine. I'm really happy to engage with people who are honest enough to admit the costs, and I'm also very happy to admit that some of the studies that have been done come to the same conclusion (eg this one from the UK SAGE committee although I have some issues with the assumptions). However I'm sick and tired of the instant dismissal you get from sanctimonious authoritarians who refuse to admit the evils of the radical global experiment that is lockdown, or refuse to admit the horrid costs of border closures."

Do the youngsters who wait tables and pour drinks at bars and restaurants need a reality check? Absolutely, say no-nonsense Sydney hospitality gurus Jake Smyth and Kenny Graham.

The Mary's Group founders, owners of the Lansdowne and Unicorn hotels and the popular Mary's venues, have unloaded on ""whining"" and ""self-entitled"" young workers, arguing the industry has over-corrected from its previous tyranny by indulging lazy behaviour and bad attitudes.

Mr Smyth said the bad old days of abusive bosses yelling at their staff in kitchens and bars had needed to change. But today's young workers hadn't suffered through that era, he said. He hoped COVID-19 would bring to light the reality that ""the hospitality industry needs an amendment in terms of relationships between employers and employees that is more based on equity and a fair outcome, not a historic over-correction"".

The Mary's owners also complained too many younger workers were obsessed with a false idea of what constituted ""work-life balance"". ""It is one of the most dangerous terms young people have been introduced to,"" said Mr Smyth, 38.

Work-life balance ... is one of the most dangerous terms young people have been introduced to.

Mr Graham said young hospitality staff often worked 32-hour weeks, woke up at midday, went to work at 4pm and spent their nights off ""getting hammered"". The men also agreed that too much time glued to phones and social media meant many younger workers did not give themselves the chance to properly unwind during their downtime.

""On your days off, just actually put your f---ing phone down,"" Mr Smyth said. ""Don't respond to the message on the WhatsApp group, and don't check your emails. Stay off Instagram. Actually treat your two days like you're on holiday.""

Speaking to The Sun-Herald, Mr Smyth said he ""100 per cent"" stood by the remarks. He also said there needed to be a nuanced conversation about the mental health and personal needs of young staff. While genuine mental health needs must always be taken seriously, too often people used ""generalised triggers"" such as mental health or poor work-life balance as an excuse, he said.


Then he backtracked with the below:


Mr Smyth acknowledged on the podcast that the vast majority of his company's young employees were ""hard-working beasts"" and only a small number were ""self-entitled little f---s""."

I can't tell you what is going through other people's minds. I can honestly say that the reason I dislike the idea is thus.


Anyone we let leave will need to eventually return. You may be happy to take the risk of being unable to return in a timely matter, however, when it does happen these things have a way of being forgotten. For every person who will stick by that conviction, there is a certain number who will see the error of their ways and add to our already huge repatriation problem.
As I said before, quarantine can fail. The laxer we are with border controls the more likely this is to be. The faster we expand capacity the more likely someone is going to slip up. As soon as that happens we might very well have another situation like Melbourne on our hands. Being COVID - free is much better for everyone's economic and mental health than the alternative.

Well, you are that person. Everybody is in a situation like this whether they can admit it or not. My girlfriend in another country called me early this morning to tell me that she doesn't see the point in living if this is it for the next few years. 


I am sorry to hear about her struggles, however, I am not prepared to risk far more lives and other long term negative health outcomes for people in other countries. It is not a 1:1 proposition, the number of people Australia will lose from suicide will be much lower than the alternative. You are thinking emotionally (which is ok), however, cooler heads must prevail and make the decisions based on the greater good.

Nobody is stopping you from staying home. 


Pretty flippant attitude when on one hand you try to guilt-trip me about one person (which I admit is saddening) while being prepared to take the risk for the rest of Australia to possibly infect thousands.

I don't disagree that the lockdown has been ""very effective"" when you measure effectiveness only by looking at covid deaths and infections. That's my whole point, that when you take into the large range of mental and physical health side effects, increased authoritarianism, loss of solidarity, impact on social interaction and relationships that I think the impact is much less effective.

To be clear I'm mainly arguing against the position that Aus should pursue lockdowns to eliminate the virus, if there is a chance that a health system could be overwhelmed then I would be in support of a lockdown, although as localised as possible.

Whilst the tide appears to be shifting a little, much of Australia is still wed to a notion that it can eliminate covid, even though no country that has had an outbreak like VIC's has been able to do. That's who I'm arguing against.

Regarding your final point on anxiety, this is an interesting one. I would love to see a cross country study on covid anxiety but I can't seem to find one. Anecdotally however, from here in the UK the level of covid anxiety appears to be much lower than it is in Australia, despite 50k covid deaths. Anxiety was much higher pre first wave when people thought the death rate was much higher than it has turned out to be. I also went to Lombardy last month and observed the same and discussed it with locals (again anecdotally), there is less anxiety post first wave.

Europe is learning to live with the virus and people are much happier for it."

I see our current state of media like an aisle of food, and lots of people are picking the junk food with loud and provocative labels. 

I believe we should be able to choose what we consume but the population needs to make an educated decision on consumption, not a decision based on misinformation. 

COVID comes to mind where some media undermined the lockdown by sowing discord, rather than presenting facts for and against and talking to virologists, rather than people with basic knowledge and strong opinions.

We definitely need this RC into media diversity to identify what needs to change so we can consume our media in a much healthier manner."

At some point, the burden outweighs the benefit. I'm a NSW resident stuck in Melbourne. I refuse to go into hotel quarantine not just for the cost, but because the bus drivers and ADF personnel were not wearing masks when my sister went through quarantine. That's outrageous. As we saw in Victoria, hotel quarantine isn't actually necessarily a safer option - if poorly handled, I could get Covid in it, or it could cause an outbreak.

Given someone from a post code with 0 active cases travelling back to NSW, the burden of hotel quarantine is high, but the risk of them spreading it is very low. Even if I weren't compelled to hotel quarantine, I basically wouldn't see anyone, and if I went outside, I wear masks all the time. Such people are extremely low risk, and to lump us in with idiots and therefore subject us to an actual risk of getting Covid (plus the expense, plus 2 weeks of isolation) seems unfair.

This whole pandemic is weighing up public health risk vs economic damage but I think individual burden and mental health has really been forgotten here.

Also, status quo bias really makes the NSW argument for keeping the border closed now look stupid."

Now this may be due to other issues, such as the continued uncertainty. But I see it considerably here in Australia, where we've basically had things under control and more or less normal lives (still with remote working, and the ""jobkeeper"" benefit) for the past six months. 

I personally think that with UBI you'll get a large number - possibly a problematically large number - of people eventually just sitting on their arses, demotivated, watching Netflix.

Italian media have reported that Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu, 72, is suspected of wiring the cash to recipients in Australia who helped to ensure hostile testimony in the abuse trial of Cardinal George Pell, who was accused of molesting choir boys in Melbourne in the 1990s.

8 steps to take to get ahead with mental health
8 steps to take to get ahead with mental health

The scandal cast a shadow yesterday over the publication of a key Vatican document calling for a more caring and sharing society and denouncing the evils of war.

Before he returned to Australia in 2017 where he was tried, jailed and acquitted on appeal, Cardinal Pell, 79, served as finance minister at the Vatican, where his attempts to clean up opaque accounting were opposed by Cardinal Becciu.

Quoting leaked documents, the Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera reported at the weekend that Vatican investigators suspect that Cardinal Becciu hoped to use the money to definitively derail Cardinal Pell’s transparency programme, which threatened to expose Cardinal Becciu’s allegedly corrupt management of Vatican cash.

Cardinal Becciu issued a strongly worded denial of the reports , stating: “I categorically deny interfering in any way in the trial of Cardinal Pell.”

Cardinal Becciu held an influential role in distributing and investing millions of euros of Catholic donations as the deputy secretary of state between 2011 and 2018 before Francis put him in charge of running the Holy See’s department responsible for making saints.

He was sacked from that job and stripped of the right to elect popes by Pope Francis last month, as Vatican investigators sifted through his spending record at the secretariat of state.

Their suspicions are focused on a multimillion investment he oversaw in a luxury property in Chelsea, London, which allegedly lost the Vatican money while making millions for consultants.

He is also allegedly suspected of funnelling Vatican cash to charities and businesses run by his three brothers. He has denied all wrongdoing.

Cardinal Becciu’s clash with Cardinal Pell came to a head in 2016 when the Australian ordered an audit of Vatican finances by an external accountancy firm. Soon after it was launched Cardinal Becciu overruled Cardinal Pell and blocked the audit.

A year later, he was behind the ousting of the Vatican’s auditor-general, Libero Milone, who was accused of spying on officials.

“Milone was Pell’s right-hand man and the enmity between Pell and Becciu was huge, although others were also riled by what they saw as Pell’s anti-Italian arrogance,” Massimo Franco, the author of The Enigma of Bergoglio, a new book about Francis, said.

After 13 months in jail and his acquittal in April, Cardinal Pell returned to Rome on September 30.

On hearing of Cardinal Becciu’s sacking, he said: “The Holy Father was elected to clean up Vatican finances. He plays a long game and is to be thanked and congratulated on recent developments.” Reacting to the comments, Cardinal Becciu said he had tried to block Cardinal Pell’s reforms, “because he had wanted to apply laws that hadn’t been promulgated yet”.

Cardinal Becciu added that he had lost his patience when Cardinal Pell accused him of being dishonest in front of the Pope. “I couldn’t allow him to say something like that . . . from the time I was a child, I had always been taught by my parents to be honest,” he said.

Francis sought to steer the Vatican back to its core message of peaceful solidarity yesterday with the release of an encyclical document, Fratelli Tutti, which urges the world to rediscover its sense of charity as it battles Covid-19.

“If only we might keep in mind all those elderly persons who died for lack of respirators, partly as a result of the dismantling, year after year, of healthcare systems,” he said. Releasing the e-document on the feast day of his namesake St Francis, who assisted the poor and preached peace, the Pope stated that war was never warranted, rejecting the Catholic Church’s traditional concept of a “just war”.

He also accused populist leaders of “appealing to the basest and most selfish inclinations of certain sectors of the population”, while criticising “trickle-down” free-market neo-liberalism for failing to stamp out poverty.

Questioning whether the right to private property was “absolute or inviolable”, he quoted early Christian thinkers who claimed, “if one person lacks what is necessary to live with dignity, it is because another person is detaining it”.

Francis said the coronavirus pandemic had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the coronavirus."

from everyone’s comments it seems like a lot of people (including you) are assuming that the percentage of dole bludgers in the regional areas is similar to that of dole bludgers in the cities (a number i do think is very low, and the libs love to blow it out of proportion). i think initially i was on the other end of the spectrum, assuming a much higher proportion were problem-welfare- recipients but the truth actually must lie somewhere in between.  i mean, it must be some sort of problem (the welfare probably not even being the cause nor the enabler of it) else the government wouldn’t be trying to solve it.

i agree, UBI is the solution. with a proper universal living wage, everyone will have the chance to thrive and the research clearly shows that almost everyone does, and few abuse it. a much better overall outcome for society. as grateful as i am for australia’s response to covid, in a way it was a missed wake up call to potentially push towards that sort of solution. i know a few other countries either did or considered implementing it once covid hit hard."

Money is a form of stored productivity. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything about you also has value, especially mental health.

The reality of work is brutal but look after yourself and remember that when money was invented part of the shit deal was that it could never stop moving, nor could we from that point.

The top 20% of households have an average income of $280k per year. Let's make a massive assumption that every household in Australia is a 2 income household. So 5 million households(for arguments sake). 1 million earning $280k(This was in 2016, so more now). With these tax savings, the 20% richest households are going to save at a minimum $11k a year due to tax cuts, which in turn means our government is losing $11,000,000,000 per year in income taxes for these people. And this is a conservative estimate. 

$11,000,000,000 can pay for, in full, the $1.2b wage subsidy the government is giving to apprentices, the $1.7b investment into Covid and other medical research, the $252m for upskilling Australians, the TOTAL funding for mental health support in Australia(currently $5.7b, but this budget is only adding $148m) and the final $2b could go to a permanent increase of at least $82 a week to welfare(This is nowhere near enough, but we've still got 80% of the country's income tax cuts to work with). 

This reduces the debt the government is seemingly aiming for, would ensure our young and our poor are better looked after and ensures that our government spending isn't completely gimped for the rest of time due to unnecessary tax cuts(These cuts are permanent.

The state is so safe, he's been having beers shouted for him by the public when he goes to the pub to chat to locals. With the money 'saved' by having an open local economy (thanks to the hard border) he's investing in renewables, given everyone $600 off their next electricity bill, and done some other really classy moves to prove that he made the right call. 

Over here there's little to no mention of the fact that QLD also had a hard border, or the fact that the border had something like a 95% approval rating within the state, so you can tell it's skewed media. Since the election is in march and the Libs were working up the illiterate class by crying on TV about ""open the border for Christmas you monster!"", the Premier is (cautiously) opening up the border juuuust before Christmas. He'll probably close it again after the election, once his approval rating jumps back up to 99%. Yes, we miss our loved ones on the East coast, and yes people stranded overseas should come home ASAP.

That’s a really shit situation to be in.

I understand family duty (Asian, second-gen immigrant Australian here) but I do get your sister’s hesitance to stay in Malaysia. Putting her studies on hold indefinitely is a big ask — Stage 3 cancer is serious but it’s not an immediate death sentence, and some people do live years past their initial prognosis. 

I do understand your frustration, and if I were in the same position, I’d drop everything and hope my sisters would too. But so far you’ve told us what you expect your sister to drop... while saying you can’t change your plans or your vision for how this will work out.

Why is deferring for a year not a good idea from your perspective? I only ask because it sounds very black and white: your sister wants to stay in Australia, you want her to go to Malaysia, no middle ground.

Is concurrent enrolment an option (honestly, I’m not sure if it is; I’ve heard of it for postgrad but it may be possible to do it as an undergraduate...)? Would your sister’s career plan benefit from postgraduate study — and if so, would she be willing to consider undergraduate in Malaysia and vocational postgrad study in Australia? Or even begin her degree in Malaysia and transfer to an Australian institution at a later date?

Definitely finish your studies; it’s a decent degree to have under your belt and has good job prospects. Why not use your Australian degree to get a job in Malaysia with a company with an Australian branch, and then transfer through that company to Australia when you’re ready?

Or, if you think job prospects are better here... is there any way you can budget for a caretaker/housekeeper while you and your sister are in Australia? You could also budget for flights back to Malaysia during semester break (assuming COVID-19 is managed well enough for borders to be open).

Are you currently an Australian PR? If not, it will take you longer to get PR (let alone citizenship) than your sister to complete a standard 3 year undergrad degree, including the one year deferral. 

Regarding your sister’s mental health — if she isn’t already seeing someone, she’ll be able to get free or cheap psych sessions (outside of the 10-20 provided by Medicare) if she is enrolled in an Australian university. I can’t speak for Malaysian universities and their student wellbeing programs but I’m not exaggerating when I say that a uni psych literally saved my life when I developed depression over the course of my studies. One of the best throngs about free/low cost nature of uni psych centres is the ability to ‘shop around’ until you find one that clicks — I should really be seeing a psych now but I don’t want to waste my Medicare sessions trying to find a good fit.

It’s a messy, awful situation and I hope you guys manage to figure out a workable solution."

Why am I not suprised they ended up being your typical entitled cunts of a boss.


arguing the industry has over-corrected from its previous tyranny by indulging lazy behaviour and bad attitudes.


He later goes on to say that ""most workers are beasts"" (read, probably wildly overworked). But of a contradiction there, isn't it?

""Cancel culture and political correctness"" is related to this how? The only thing I can think of that might fit for this is people boycotting companies abusing employees or breaking laws (like with the recent low down in Vic). Of course those don't fit into either, that's just Australians doing as Australians should do - tell entitled cunts to fuck off.


""It's almost impossible to run a business now without offending somebody. It's almost impossible to run a life without f---ing offending somebody,""


This has always been the case. People can be entitled wankers. The difference between what they're acting like and reality is that a business judged as good by the masses won't be killed by it, rather then just being killed/damaged because people are all entitled. What's the saying? If everyone looks like an arsehole to you you're probably the arsehole? 


Mr Smyth said the bad old days of abusive bosses yelling at their staff in kitchens and bars had needed to change. But today's young workers hadn't suffered through that era, he said. 


""Now those old bad things needed to change, but"".

No you dick heads, no buts. That was bad, it needed to change. Exactly as you say in the very next paragraph our parents fought for this shit to go away - for a better life for us. This shouldn't regress because you want another few dollars.


He hoped COVID-19 would bring to light the reality that ""the hospitality industry needs an amendment in terms of relationships between employers and employees that is more based on equity and a fair outcome, not a historic over-correction"".


Absolutely correct. Although I'm sure his view on what ""equity and a fair outcome"" is quite different to what it should be given that last line...


The Mary's owners also complained too many younger workers were obsessed with a false idea of what constituted ""work-life balance"". ""It is one of the most dangerous terms young people have been introduced to,"" said Mr Smyth, 38.

""The luxury that I got given as a kid was you can choose what you want to be. That was the thing my parents and my grandparents fought to give me. I thought the whole idea was trying to find a f---ing job that you loved, and that's your work-life balance.""


Of course they're complaining about ""work life balance"". Because if you aren't totally dedicated to your work, if you aren't basing your weekdays around work, you're just entitled! Also, of course, assuming everyone working in hospitality wants to work there and entirely ignores the compensation part of ""work life balance"".


Work-life balance ... is one of the most dangerous terms young people have been introduced to.


For employers that don't care about their employees I'm sure. Must be such a scary thing having to think about how your employees feel D:


Mr Graham said young hospitality staff often worked 32-hour weeks, woke up at midday, went to work at 4pm and spent their nights off ""getting hammered"". The men also agreed that too much time glued to phones and social media meant many younger workers did not give themselves the chance to properly unwind during their downtime.


Again, contradicting a later statement. I'd also point out that 32 hour work weeks seem more like a workplace problem, either improper compensation or unsecure/poor hours. No-one is going to want to work from 4pm - 12am.

And as for the latter bit, who are these muppets to say what people should enjoy doing in their free time?


""On your days off, just actually put your f---ing phone down,"" Mr Smyth said. ""Don't respond to the message on the WhatsApp group, and don't check your emails. Stay off Instagram. Actually treat your two days like you're on holiday.""


Demands workers work late hours and gets shitty when they use phones during shifts, blames workers for having to do things on their days off.


Mr Smyth acknowledged on the podcast that the vast majority of his company's young employees were ""hard-working beasts"" and only a small number were ""self-entitled little f---s"".


Statement they've been contradicting... I'd also ask why you employ those ""self entitled little fucks"" if you think they're like that? Or does the Australian law prevent poor old you from firing workers that do just what they're told to rather then going ""above and beyond"".


He also said there needed to be a nuanced conversation about the mental health and personal needs of young staff. While genuine mental health needs must always be taken seriously, too often people used ""generalised triggers"" such as mental health or poor work-life balance as an excuse, he said.


Absolutely! Unfortunately he immediately burns down that attempt at sympathy by blaming them rather then looking at his own business to see why that might effect workers mental health.


""It's just this slippery slope of scapegoating your own mental health responsibilities,"" he said. ""It shows up in poor work ethic, lateness, too much drinking, poor performance at work in general. 


*Said while scapegoating workers for what in all likelihood is actually workplace insecurity, poor pay and shit management if these arseholes statements are anything to go off. 


""Exercise and hard work and diet change really does a lot for mental health. Co-opting blame doesn't."" 


First off, that's entirely incorrect. Blaming the appropriate sources when they're out of your control does wonders for mental health (at least in my experience, as it keeps you from blaming yourself for shit out of your control). Secondly, secure and appropriately paying work with a workplace that treats you like a person will do far more for your mental health then anything else could. Be it due to secondary factors like having the time/being able to afford a therapist (I'd assume, never had one myself) or just not having to worry about bills or one inappropriate statement resulting in you dealing with centrelink. 

""Hard work"" is also pretty likely to make your mental health worse... Unfortunately can say that was true for my father. 


Mr Smyth also said the ""power of hard work and application"" seemed to have been lost. ""In my experience, the harder you work the better you feel,"" he said.


In your experience... As a manager? Wonder if he's worrying about job security or bills, or if he actually has to work as hard as his workers to start with? 

But to address the statement, hasn't it been found that workers today are the most efficient they've ever been?


""There seems to have been an explosion of laying the blame for your own lack of ambition or inability to disconnect from social media on work, as opposed to calling it for what it is, which is you not taking f--king responsibility for your own agency and own position in life."" 


Rather ironic given he's got a whole article worth of blaming workers for ""poor"" work ethic, eh?"

If Aus had got Covid like Europe, like the Americas, like much of Asia, so much of this wouldn't be an issue. Australians would blame the virus, not travellers or Victorians or hotel security guards like they do now. We would have seen the same solidarity around our health staff and essential workers that other countries did. Our states could have worked together to get on top of this, not have pulled themselves apart and abandoned each other and each other's citizens like we've seen. There would of course be horrible other issues, but Aus' situation is now very unique. 

But instead of ""catching covid"" at the same time as everyone else, the country has been cursed to experience the same thing the rest of the world has but six months later. And many of you understandably think that we could have got through this somehow, we could have been the lucky country yet again. You think that this is somehow someone's fault. But this time we aren't lucky. This is a global pandemic and it's happened before. No one escaped the Spanish Flu and when that happened and spread we didn't even have planes! Covid is an incredibly infectious disease with a massive incubation period spread by asymptomatic people. It can be contained, but never defeated (without a vaccine). No country in the world, once the virus has taken hold, has eliminated it.

Appreciate I'm rambling, I'm not expecting to change anyone's mind, but I think my key point is as follows:

Many of you think that detractors of lockdown and elimination don't value lives, in particular the lives of the elderly and vulnerable. You think that they're callous grandma killers (although the virus kills far more grandpas...), or that they're selfish. But what might be really hard to understand is that many of us DO see the costs of covid. We know it's awful, we know it can grow quickly, we know there's much we don't know about it and we know that awfully, people will be killed by it. We're not selfish, we know that some of those people might be OUR grandparents, OUR parents. I genuinely understand where someone like /u/dredd is coming from, he/she has a noble priority for lives and I don't begrudge them for it in the slightest.

So it's not that we don't value these things. Rather it's that we value some other things SO MUCH. I value the right for families to be able to see each other SO MUCH. Humans are social creatures, and I value the genuine joy that people experience seeing their friends SO MUCH. I value the freedom that comes from living in a liberal democracy SO MUCH, the freedom to see people express themselves, to laugh and to celebrate SO MUCH. I value the mental health of our society so much. I've personally been impacted by suicide and depression and anxiety in various ways, and I genuinely am terrified that we're asking for a crisis the likes of what we've never seen before on these things. And of course I value the right to privacy and movement (that of everyone, not just my own), so much.

It's not that I don't see the benefits of lockdown and elimination (again, I stress that I do), it's that the costs are too great. And whilst many of the benefits are unknown (the general effectiveness of a vaccine, the timing, whether it will actually be effective for old and vulnerable people), the costs are so much easier to see. As with all trade-offs it's a balancing act, a spectrum, a line to skate across. And all I'm arguing is that we're beyond that line now. 

So please, please just consider not whether you might be wrong, but what it would take to convince you that you were wrong. There are no parties or ideologies or states anymore, it's just Australians now. In short, where do you draw the line?"

I have no formal education in finance or economics, and this is pure speculation brought on by family members' being out of work long-term, and the fact I like to follow news about the retail sector.

Straight after Christmas, Jobseeker is cut. 

But Christmas! Aussies love Christmas shopping! But shit, all those pauses and hiatuses on things like rent, mortgages, insurances, and utilities have come due, so your bills are way higher than normal. And Jobseeker's supplement has just been halved. So people cut back - Christmas is light on, with a focus on necessities rather than indulgences. They're going to make sure they have money saved for rent and utilities in the coming months.

So the profit margins of retail and hospitality dip quite dramatically during one of their most profitable times and there will be sheer panic from CEOs and all those people who have more money than common sense. Businesses lay off any Christmas casuals they bothered hiring (because thanks to COVID, a lot of sure-bets in Christmas retail employment are not hiring) and then they have to let go of a few long-term casuals/part-timers because the shops don't need that many staff members with so few customers. More unemployed joining the queues and the job hunt.

Then people start to fall behind on rent or on their mortgage/car payments/whatever because January 1 has passed and despite applying for 20+ jobs a week, they're still on Jobseeker and now living below the poverty line. There's only so long you can negotiate before you lose your home. Not to mention having to negotiate with whichever dubious job provider you're assigned to for work-for-the-dole and meetings being rescheduled to go to job interviews. Plus a lot of businesses hate the constant harassment from job providers, and flat out will not deal with their candidates because of the endless nagging from the job providers - who get approximately $3k per successful placement, so they are really annoying to employers about evidence and paperwork. 

A lot of people are going to suffer. There's going to be a crisis in housing and mental health. But Scomo's managed to fund religious representatives in public schools, so everything will be fine."

Despite it's widespread use, private security normalized or otherwise shouldn't be used here, we can call that a lesson learned. There's this perception that security get adequate training, they don't. Nor do they have the equipment and training to enforce a quarantine, in a hospital setting they are just muscle for the doctors and nursing staff who call the shots and are backed up by the police when needed. 
This is really a job for the Police and Army. This isn't me shitting on my former profession; it's just a matter of training, discipline and consequences if they fuck up.

Scotty's leave it up to the states approach has also created a scenario where we now have 8 covid response plans (7 for each state and territory, 1 federal) and a group of state leaders that compare notes. A far better approach would have been for a federal panel of experts, epidemiologists and the like who could put out/filter down a consistent national message (in a alternate universe where we have competent federal leadership): 


Add a mandatory jail sentence (or psych hold depending on case) for breaching self isolation and make it a federal offense. Rich arseholes treat the current fine like extra fees and charges, that needs to stop.
Break isolation protocols into level 1/2. 1 Is what we have now, used for states like SA where testing is being done, but is still low risk. 2 Is that but the household is isolated as well, used for outbreak states like Victoria. One person isolating in a family home or share accommodation is a joke.
Start a national CovIdiot Hotline. If people believe state and federal police are taking border jumpers seriously, maybe there won't be as much vigilante vandalism and hostility to interstate license plate holders and the like. 
That had recommended (or mandated) lockdown procedures for the states to follow.
Coordinated the current clusterfuck that is interstate travel before it causes a major outbreak across multiple states.
Class Q-anon, Sovereign Citizen and Anti-Vaxx groups as national security threats for the duration of the pandemic. Allow the police to have border hopping and dangerous ones detained and treated as high risk mental health patients (imo they actually meet the medical criteria, some of what they believe is batshit insane). 
Publicly tell the shock jocks and antimask opinion heads from newscorp to shut the fuck up already. It's not a hoax, masks work at reducing infection chance.
A Covid app that wasn't DOA, because the overpriced contract to make it went to scotty's mate.
International arrivals quarantine at somewhere like Easter Island, under guard. No honor system, no chances for fuckups, no special rules for rich arseholes.
The ability for the army to quickly construct mobile medical quarantine facilities with negative pressure rooms, so hospitals can be expanded in states that get hard hit. Also to allow proper quarantine in aged care facilities so 10+ aren't dying a day. Also hospitals in all states need to be retrofitted with more (or in some case a) negative pressure ward(s), especially in areas with large elderly demographics (the tradies will love the work, especially right now).
Forcefeed Clive Palmer all the Hydroxychloroquine he imported and televise what it does to him. 
Move high risk aged care from those for-profit death traps into un-used hospital wards
Also the fact that we treat aged care like a job network, i.e. as a taxpayer funded liability shield for the federal government - yeah that has to stop. That rort has been ignored so long and now it's killed a lot of people. Reform isn't a strong enough word, gutted, maybe even nationalized.


At a minimum though, I'd want them to not claim there was ""modelling"" that supported their bullshit herd immunity blather and instead listen to actual people with medical degrees and specializations in infectious disease management. 

Aside from that, we actually did learn a lot of lessons from SARS, MERS, H1N1. Through the WHO we partnered with the US government and a bunch of other countries to create a new global system for creating pandemic vaccines faster than has ever been possible. Bill Gates also threw a bunch of research funding at it, which is why the world has a whole bunch of different covid vaccines starting human trials. I believe Australia has two, one out of a QLD (I think) uni and the other was developed out of Flinders Medical in Adelaide."

I've been on DSP since 2011 and it was difficult back then, they've made it much harder since then, and there is a HUGE processing time which will be even longer now due to covid (but you will usually get back paid for the time you need to wait.) 

I have a friend who successfully applied/ got on it late last year for ASD/ mental health issues. It took them 12 FUCKING MONTHS for their application to get processed. It is not written anywhere, but is a ""known expectation"" that you will likely need to appeal your declined application to the Commonwealth Ombudsman to get anywhere. They did get back-paid what they would have received for those 12 months if they had have been approved straight away. I think they might have had to push a bit for that. 

I think it's worth applying. Centrelink only really let's you apply for 1 disability condition as it were - not a combo. So you get to pick your mental health condition or a physical condition. If you have a good GP and at least 1 specialist that you have a history with, who knows how your disability affects you and your ability to work, and you think they could fill out in-depth forms truthfully reflecting this, go for it. 

My advice to anyone dealing with Centrelink is to start a dedicated journal for your dealings with them. It sounds insane, but you need to 1000% cover your arse. 

Every single time you have any kind of contact with them, you need to record it. 

In person - date, time, who you spoke to, what you said, what THEY SAID, and most importantly A COPY OF ANY PAPERWORK RECEIVED OR GIVEN TO THEM. Centrelink are notorious for ""losing"" paperwork, or mis-scanning it so only parts of documents are there, which is then your fault. 

Same with phone calls. Date, time, Service Reps name and a receipt # for the call. 

Screen shots of every online thing you do.

Be prepared to call them once a week/ fortnight/ whatever ""to see how your application is going"" and get a non-answer. Be prepared to be told you need to fill out more of the same forms, or a completely different form than you were told before. Be prepared to get given a different answer from every person you speak to. If you get that far, be prepared for an interview with some Centrelink knob (or a team of them!) who's looked over your paperwork and then asks you questions, trying to dig into and figure out if you are able to do any kind of job, despite your provided evidence. 

Jump through the hoops. You might be successful!"

When I moved to Melbourne, I had to first of all find a GP who actually knew something about mental health. That took 3 months to do. Then after doing that, get my files sent to them from my last GP, which took another month. Then I need a Mental Health Care Plan. All good, except I need the referral sent to the psychologist. Which psychologist? 

I then spend a couple of days online trying to figure out which psychologist is most appropriate for me. I call them to ask when I would be able to book an appointment for. They tell me that once they get my referral, they will call me to book a time. And they all say this

I then go back to the GP to get them to send the referral to the psychologist. And then I wait... two more weeks go by. It has now been 4 and a half months, and my psychologist from the last place I was at went on maternity leave just after I moved. I have now been without support for 4 and a half months.

So, when I finally get a call from the psychologist (3 weeks after the referral was sent), I'm told there are no appointments for 2 months. I take the appointment they can give me. 2 months later, I go see the psychologist, and I find that after 2 sessions, that this is not the psychologist for me. Now I have to go back to the GP, to get another referral to another psychologist. Rinse and repeat. After almost a year of this, I finally found a psychologist who worked for me. 

I also needed a psychiatrist... luckily, the first psychiatrist I met was a good one, but it still took six months after moving to Melbourne to see him

And all of this was back in 2014/2015... well before Covid

The system is well and truly broken. And yes, it is all about me. I am a human being who through no fault of my own lives in constant mental distress. If this were a physical ailment, I would not be treated this way

The parallels between gaslighting, trolling, rickrolling, and other assorted online behavior in that category, and offline social and cultural conventions is the best way I have found to quickly demonstrate and instill self-confidence and reduce social anxiety. This is vital because none of the Youth I teach genuinely feel like there is a future for them.

A.I. will take jobs away, COVID-19 will never end, the ego of older generations keeps making them feel like they are supposed to be autistic or have mental health problems, the young men also feel like even approaching a woman is somehow rape and they just want to be respectful, the young women feel stressed because of social media beauty standards so they simply end up emulating what they think being attractive is and suppress their natural desire to be explored and to explore others with their truth.

The above list could go on and on. The primary focus is to help shift them away from expectations other place on them (reducing anxiety; freeing up mental energy and enabling focus) and onto them realizing that they are a unique thing that is even worth them focusing on in their private time. Balancing the ego of arrogance and ignorance in favor of memory and language practices is a key approach.

One mother, Clancy, tells how she tried for months to have her son, Ben, admitted to a psychiatric hospital before he stabbed a stranger in the neck near a bus stop, on the command of “angels” telling him to hunt and kill paedophiles. The random victim, a father of two (and not a paedophile), died. Another mother, “Susan”, begged for her own son, “Michael”, to be similarly admitted. She was told there were no acute beds available. Michael returned home and, believing his five-year-old son was the devil, stabbed him to death.

These acts of random terror play into what are among our deepest fears: those of the unpredictable and the familiar. Despite the significant work that has been done to demystify and destigmatise mental illness during recent decades, the mere experience of speaking with someone who, in the medicalised system’s clinical discourse, is “responding to internal stimuli” is disturbingly unsettling. Mental illness is commonly described as “disorder”, which provides a clue as to why this is so. Psychosis – a mental state characterised by a disconnection from reality – seems to threaten the tightly strung sense of order we’ve all implicitly agreed on. And when, in the worst of all cases, people act on their “internal stimuli” by killing others, the disorder in the psychotic’s mind is writ large in an event that shatters the order of entire universes.

Four Corners gave us those shattered families on Monday. What had failed those mothers was a lack of treatment. Had their sons been detained, secured and medicated, they may not have killed. And in presenting these grieving mothers, Four Corners gave us one story of contemporary mental health in Australia: mental illness is unpredictable and scary; there aren’t enough beds; there’s not enough involuntary treatment.

It’s a story that would have been a hard sell in other times, when people diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were shut away in asylums and hospitals of the kind we read about in Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night, Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and, in Australia, in Peter Kocan’s The Treatment and The Cure, products of the time Kocan spent in the Morisset Mental Hospital after he tried to shoot Arthur Calwell in the head during the 1966 election campaign. These are 20th-century stories of the agitation for liberty and agency in the face of the gigantic fog machine of the bureaucratic state.

Since the reforms of the 1990s, which saw hospital beds repurposed, wards shrunk and asylums replaced by the laudable goal of “community mental health”, the focus of our concerns has shifted from individual liberty to public safety and security. This shift has occurred at a much broader cultural level, and it hasn’t only affected mental health. The sentencing of criminal offenders has largely junked the offender-focused reforms of the 1970s and onwards, and we increasingly clamour out of rage and fear for longer and tougher sentences. People charged with violent crimes on flimsy evidence spend months on remand as magistrates, petrified of releasing another Adrian Bayley, refuse more and more bail. Today’s answer to Kesey and Kocan are books like Killer Instinct: Having a Mind for Murder, by a former Queensland Health psychiatrist (who has been accused of breaching patient confidentiality in the book).

The reframing of the threat of terrorism, especially since 2001, has meant that we’ve welcomed the barrage of liberty-crushing laws that has followed. PR for various coercive state agencies is presented as “reality” TV and is popular enough to air at prime time. Federal and state police are now consistently rated as Australia’s most trusted institutions, as reported in polls. The cultural shift I’m referring to can most clearly be seen in our collective attitude towards people fleeing war and persecution.

But the fog machine still functions. People who hurt others or damage property and are found to have been of “unsound mind” at the time, or to be “unfit to plead” in a criminal court, are diverted into a bewilderingly opaque system of public mental health, in which “treatment” is forced onto them for an indefinite period. Psychiatry has come such a long way since Freud’s early experiments with analysis that “talking therapy” is rarely, if ever, available to patients on involuntary treatment orders.

The unluckiest among such patients still spend months, years or even decades as inpatients in hospital psychiatric wards, as overstretched psychiatric consultants trial different combinations of potent psychotropic compounds and hope that one of them eventually works to reduce psychotic symptoms without merely sedating people. Lobotomies may belong to the past, but Ken Kesey still has much to say.

This situation, observed through the lens Four Corners provides, is presented as a small price to pay for public safety and security. But the solution suggested by “Don’t Judge Us” – more beds, more secure wards, more forced treatment, less liberty – ignores a parallel story of risk-averse health authorities and mental health tribunals detaining people in locked wards for months or years beyond what is demonstrably necessary. The assumption behind “Don’t Judge Us” – that involuntary treatment on secure wards is effective – should be met with significant scepticism. Sometimes, yes. But too often, “inpatient” status seems to be the way we reassert order in the face of the perceived threat posed by the disordered mind itself, rather than the result of the assessment of actual risk.

“Paul”,* now in his fifties, was diagnosed as schizophrenic three decades ago. Irritable and obsessive, he responded to a relationship breakdown by temporarily becoming even more so. Police took out a no-contact intervention order protecting his sister against her wishes. When he breached it by knocking on her door and threatening suicide, he was charged and then diverted out of the magistrates’ courts and into involuntary treatment, since which time he’s been pumped full of every psychotropic in existence. He’s no longer able to work. Everything he says and does is now interpreted through the lens of the diagnosis; the minutiae of his daily existence are now dictated by doctors, nurses and hospital administrators who have little interest in self-reflection. Complaints about staff are “paranoia”. Complaints about pain are “delusions”. The desire for freedom is an “unrealistic goal”. Expressions of anger are “aggression” and “psychosis”. Seven years later, Paul remains in a locked hospital ward, under the most restrictive order available under his state’s mental health legislation. He’s never once been violent to anyone.

For every Ben and Michael, there’s a Paul, perhaps many Pauls. Each bed occupied by a Paul is one that is unavailable to a Ben or a Michael. This is at least part of the reason for the paucity of mental health resources complained about on Four Corners. Reform of the mental health system doesn’t just mean more bricks, mortar and hospital mattresses. It means subjecting the whole of the machine to fundamental re-examination. What is its purpose? What are the power relations it supports? How can we support mental health and wellbeing while also respecting human dignity?

*Patients subject to involuntary treatment orders are among the clients the author represents. “Paul” is an amalgam of two clients, with some minor details changed to protect their confidentiality.

They (mask exempt) expect everyone to respect their reasons for being exempt, yet we (the greater public) have to deal with both an increased physical threat (Covid) and increased mental health threat (Covid/lockdowns/ restrictions). I don’t think one persons physical or mental problems should be above the mental and physical problems that may impact the greater public. You could argue that their exempt status results in an increase of mental health and and physical health problems for the greater public, thus resulting in a greater net loss overall for public health. 

I understand some people have genuine reasons, but what reason could be more important than ensuring we as a collective get through this, especially when Covid zero is our aim for the time being. 

This is just food for thought from a systems perspective, with the greater society in mind. Not anti-exemptions, I just know of a lot of people who’ve got exemptions for very poor reasons."

The point of tougher bail is that there’s less offences because the recidivist crooks who commit dozens of offences are off the streets. Reddit has this weird idea that crooks commit one or two offences, and then reform or go to prison.

When they maliciously slashed the COVID supplement before a single vaccination had entered the country they also sneakily reinstated the New Residents Waiting Period which meant our household lost a full Centrelink payment. 

By a complete miracle my wife got a new casual job right after that happened, but the workplace has been toxic and completely detrimental to her mental health, while I’ve been grinding away trying to get a graduate job or just any job (the stress of job searching and constant rejection recently sent me to the psych ward) she is getting more beaten down by this horrible job that thanks to the federal government reinstating that waiting period she’s had no choice but to put up with just so with her few hours a week casual and my tiny jobseeker payment we can keep a roof over our heads. 

The poverty that these sadistic private school fucks lock us into is killing us and I don’t think I can survive another LNP term."

In our experience, COVID has really diverted resources away from mental health. My sister has been sick with severe anxiety and anorexia for an extended period, and she is now at the stage where she is nearing organ failure. Her condition has deteriorated massively over the last 14 to 15 months, as resources that were previously made available for mental health have now been redeployed to the health emergency. Nurses and specialists that used to be on her ward have been moved into front line staffing roles as other nurses have been moved to testing facilities etc. 

My parents spend their days watching my sister lay in the general ward of their local hospital, watching my sister waste away while doctors argue over which resources to devote to her. The private clinics are absolutely stressed beyond breaking point, and the waiting (after crossing a state border) is currently 3 months (yes we are on the list, but others keep getting prioritised). 

Numerous letters to local members, state medical ministers and federal ministers usually come back with the same copy pasta - that the government has never spent more money on health and recently contributed an extra blah blah blah in the budget. 

I understand the importance of devoting resources to the COVID response, but people are literally withering away in hospitals around the country waiting for basic mental health services. Mental health needs its own dedicated system, so that resources aren't diverted to general health in situations like these."

The devastation to the economy and mental health isn't COVID, it's government decisions to lock down and impose themselves on people's wellbeing for a 0.97% fatality rate. In the case of the U.S., it's also because most of you are fat and hypertense."

Do you remember who said that? On the weekend I read the claim was NSW police said they couldn't take her statement due to covid (which is not true as they'd have travel exemption or SAPOL could do it), then she contacted them the day before she suicided to say she no longer wished to proceed.  Saying she was too unwell to pursue it is a new adjustment, and I'm going to take it with a grain of salt too, as the mental health of the victim seems to be a weapon through which government-friendly media will be inclined to 'beat' her. 

The timeline to me sounds like she gave up after 6 months because they weren't doing anything about it :("

From then on, there were talks about providing mental health services to those people and how difficult their lives must be to not be at work. Which was pretty much what I'd talk about at my employment office before all the shit hit the fan, but the sentiment of ""they're all just lazy dole bludgers who leech off taxpayer money"" still hung in the air when I was unemployed. 

When the pandemic hit, I ended up in an essential services position, which was ironic because I got work when everyone was losing theirs. Around this time, there were also articles about how awful the Centrelink system was by the same people who went on about how people in the dole ""needed to make the system work for them"", like nobody significant knew that Centrelink was designed to be excruciatingly complicated. These were conversations the unemployed had ad nauseum, but there was always someone who would pipe in with, ""you're just lazy"", and dismiss it for a complete lack of experience in what the jobless were saying. It amazes me that we needed to hit a pandemic-level crisis for people to understand that being jobless isn't fun and games like everyone said it was. 

Additionally, employers deal with a lot of people during hiring and most applicants don't know what they're talking about which shows in the application. Based on this, I also tried to think of better activities for the group sessions based on my observations with employers and what they were looking for in a person to fill a position, rather than the basic stuff that serves no purpose other than to tick a box somewhere. For example, I knew a guy who was unemployed for several months and in desperation he came to me asking how to get a job so I told him to research a position before applying for it, and he got a job within a week. This wasn't covered in any group session I had attended and it's such a simple solution to an otherwise impossible problem. 

Another idea I had was the group cpuld to develop a business idea that could work in their area and each person needed to be assigned a role in that business and research a little on how to fulfill their role. Doing this would help clients to understand that fulfilling a role involves more than just having the willingness to work and perhaps inspire people to look at starting businesses in the local area, thus creating jobs and building the local economy. Again, none of this was addressed in the group sessions.

I considered two possible theories for these clear oversights in the system: either the people who came up with the group activities didn't understand what the hell they were doing and had biases predicated on their experiences and ideas, or the system was broken by design due to the fact that economies don't collapse with an unemployment rate of at least 5%."

You either have Covid Zero or Covid in the community and most countries that have gone done that path have had to have worse restrictions than majority of Australia has had for longer periods. They have also had to deal with friends and family getting sick and dealing with workplaces closing down due to active cases and not being able to visit your elderly relatives.

So considering that, how many more beds have been added to hospitals since the 1st lockdown? None? Of course. If it was about that, more beds would have been added, the govt would be talking about people taking sensible precautions like avoiding people when possible, and improving your personal health, like losing weight, reducing nutritional deficiencies, and improving fitness etc etc.

Lets talk about the young people who you call selfish. Out of the 30,000 odd cases we have had in oz, only 7 under 50 have died. The lockdown is damaging the young people more than the virus. You call the protesters selfish, what a f*****g joke! Those are the same young people whose rate of home ownership has been going down, the same young people whose mental health has been getting worse year after year, the same young people whose job security has been getting worse, with higher mortgage burdens, longer hours, and less benefits. The same young people who have been told they aren't allowed to have a livelihood when their parents lived through boom times and never had to take years off out of their career. Now, those people are not even allowed to work, and you have no solution for them. Covid is all that matters, and stopping it is all that matters, consequences be damned! They will have to pay for this with their futures! More taxes, less years to earning money, a larger deadweight loss. Oh well, you don't care.

Also understand that lockdown only slows the spread of a virus, it doesn't mean it won't exist anymore. The govt has proven it can only stop it spreading, but can't stop it from returning time after time after time. Vaccines? What if there is immune escape? You will blame the freedom lovers for their own imprisonment.

Obviously, those young people can go get f****d, for the greater good."

Feb(I was sick two weeks before lockdown) to june is a lot of time to spend by yourself. It was only when it got to June/July you were allowed to meet someone for a walk in the park. That's a long time to be on your own and has big impacts on mental health. I went for 6 months + without physical human contact (no handshakes, hugs, etc).

I really needed to get out to see my family and friends. I guess maybe that would fall under the health category, but otherwise it could mean I would be at the back of the priority."

I work with the public and have to use public toilets at work, and I've been anxious about covid to the point where I'm constantly on edge and can't concentrate on work at all. I'm getting about 4 hours sleep per night. My boss knows about this and is supportive of me using a few weeks of sick leave for my mental health - I just need a doctor's certificate. 

I had a Telehealth appointment yesterday and the doctor said he can only authorise 2-3 days for anxiety; any longer and I would need to see a psychiatrist. I said I've been seeing a psychologist for anxiety and asked if that would count. He said, ""okay, you can have the rest of this week off, that's four days."" 

I said I need the leave from next week, and he said ""we can't give leave in advance, call back next week."" He then said goodbye and hung up.

I really wanted to give my employer notice as we're understaffed right now, but it looks like that isn't possible. I'll ring the doctor again next week, but in the meantime I thought I'd ask if anyone has any experience with this. Is a psychologist's word enough, or do I need to book a psychiatrist?

I will reiterate why I bring another health related issue into the conversation (using Obesity as it is one of the largest one's affecting first world countries).

The current Covid lockdown is an unjust use of force based on the amount of people suffering being disproportional to the response especially once you factor in the damages lockdown has done (decrease mental health, increase domestic violence, cancer diagnosis being delayed[Mainly a uk thing], businesses failing) and how we have a better response to Covid (which is provable by the decrease in fatalities overtime (look at any graph about covid of the infected to death ratio online) and the latest variant being less deadly than the original variant [the abc link]. Even in India the Delta variant had a lower mortality of 1.36% than the 2.1% globally.)

NOW AS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION: is it justified to use the same force and governmental powers to target [Health Issue]? If yes. why haven't you done so ? (But you believe it's not so you do not have to answer this question)If no, why when Obesity has a provable negative effect on the health care system (through increased cost and use of resources that otherwise could be used else) do we not use state powers to decrease Obesity?

You mention how we have a more pressing issue to deal but Obesity is linked to higher rates of Covid deaths (https://www.worldobesity.org/news/obesity-and-covid-19-policy-statement). So no bringing up Obesity is not Whataboutism but is relevant to the Covid topic as reducing Obesity would reduce Covid deaths (if you disagree with this statement contact the worldobesity dot org website and take it up with them.) Obesity was a deliberate choice and your dismissal of Obesity more shows your lack of knowledge on health than it does mine.Your Pro Annoxria jab is irrelevent and is just a way to score cheap points (do prove me otherwise if you please). But it clearly shows that I have not properly conveyed the point I am trying to get across.Of course this is irrelevant as the main point I make is the use of force. I WILL REITERATE: THE USE OF FORCE is the argument I am focusing on and you have yet to make a convincing argument why we should not use force against the obese (or any other health issue like alcohol or cigarettes as other examples) whether it be now or in the future when Covid is gone or completely irrelevant.

I do not care if lockdown's are effective at all (there is no definitive proof anyway as you will find studies suggesting one thing and the we can both post countries/states where lockdown did and didn't work) as Authoritarianism on display is what I am against and the clear dismissal of every other health issue as less important, despite the fact as I posted above they are.

You're assuming that it's random flinging of unsubstantiated claims. 


The individual was known to the accused
There's proof lining up of her accusation of the dates and times of the attack


This can't ""just happen"" to anyone, and you're ignoring that there has to be evidence. At this stage, the poor woman has committed suicide, probably due to the mental toll this process would have taken on her as the police couldn't interview her for several months during COVID. 

These are unusual circumstances, but there's plenty of evidence to go off without witness testimony to investigate at least some of the claims of Porter or to see if the victim made contact over the years. 

So ""not sustainable"" insinuates there's no evidence here and anyone at any time can make a claim. Which is false. 

Secondly when such a large cloud hangs over someone - it affects their working relationships. 

No woman would want to sit down with Christian Porter right now to discuss one on one anything relating to professional work. It creates a large question of trust over the person until its resolved as its a very serious allegation with some evidence behind it.

Stop making out like anyone could do this at any time and as though the implications of such a severe charge wouldn't have an affect on their job - which happens to affect millions of Australians. 

Their integrity is key - even if it's just mental health. 

Standing people aside is normal practice. See Justice Heydon or George Pell - both stood down from their roles while investigations were under way as it creates a too-fucking-complex situation for them dealing with everyday interactions with colleagues when the role demands trust."

There's a risk of under 60s getting a blood clot and dying and at this particular data point, we have little Covid in the community, therefore we don't advise getting a vaccine in that age group. Because the risk is greater than 0.

Yet, we take that advice and our community is permanently waiting for the government to sort out a vaccine rollout, we experience countless lockdowns which cost billions of dollars, people die from mental health issues relating to livelihood and financial livelihoods but that was all cool because we saved two people from dying to a rare clotting issue.

The governments let us down by allowing it to be re introduced, but at the same time individuals using their brains could have avoided it as well. Not to mention the spreading was done by us, the people, the public, individuals. Everyone is to blame here.

When we heard about the Limo driver, did people cancel gatherings, start wearing masks, stop going to the gym and so on? No.. people carry on about normal for the most part, a few would have but at large no one gave a toss until they were told to.

We were let down, but then we caused the issue we hate to grow and keep growing, even you and me people doing the right thing. Are we calling out every single daft cunt we see doing the wrong thing? No we are not and in some ways we can't without fearing for ourselves which shows what kind of messed up society we live in where the people doing the right thing have to fear those who are not.

Hot take but all the people going to parks and trails for exercise.. why? I know the chances of transmission are going to be lower outdoors as well as a much greater chance for distance between people however why take the chance? Unless you have some super specific medical condition some basic stuff around the house will suffice for lock down and if you happen to be some athlete or body builder or what have you, chances are you have the means to do what you need at home at least enough to get through the 2 weeks and it would only be 2 weeks if everyone did the right thing.

The shops are pretty empty and a lot of people are doing the right thing, but the government either by choice or because there is some stupid laws not letting them. refuse to do anything substantial in terms of deterrents. The people in the city for the protest.. there has to be some punishment for every single one of them.. The fines for people visiting someone at the moment are what, a few grand at most? Make it a cool half mil and 5 years jail. In times like this where everyone wants it to be over just put the measures in place to get it done.

This comes back to why it's all our faults. Government either wont or cannot enforce the lock down, but we enable people to flaunt the rules. I have no clue who the people are still going out and what they are doing, but clearly it's still happening because there should have been no new cases for weeks now if people did the right thing.

Fully understand more than most how this can impact on someones mental health, but guess what the best way to help them is? Make it a quick and painless lock down. I have seen more people out and about in my neighborhood the last month than ever before. The restrictions were not tight enough quick enough and I would argue that right now they are still not tight enough. Once again though we land back on the people.. how hard is it so just stay at home if you don't NEED to be out.  

I agree we shouldn't be using lock downs as the solution, but if people would stop acting like covid was never a thing 3 weeks after there is no new cases we wouldn't continue to have them. All people had to do was hold out a bit longer on social shit, I know there is the cluster fuck of a vaccine roll out but be the better people and push through till we are at a point where it is probably chill to try and go back to 'normal'.  

The TLDR of this is as much as I completely agree with shitting on those in charge, because it is their fault, don't let the general public at large off the hook. We are the ones spreading it, if you need to be told to wear a mask before you will wear one, you are the problem. Ever since this started I have not left the house without a mask on. Guess I expect to much of everyone to take personal responsibility, the people in power included.  

Until everyone accepts personal responsibility these type of things will keep happening."

We have the highest youth suicide rate. And yet things like “COVID students mental health funds” go without sending a spent due to (no kidding) COVID. 

Many younger people are very disfranchised with our government, we have an incredibly selfish boomer population who ensure whoever holds power maintains the status quo.

Tack on an incredibly predatory and unethical property management company every man and their dog has and it's just the bees knees being a renter in New Zealand!

If the article was about paramedics or COVID ward nurses needing extra mental health support, I don't think we'd see this subreddit pile on and with whataboutisms, saying ""they don't need any special treatment"" or ""they knew what they signed up for"". 

I spent 3.5 years at 2cdo and did 2 SOTG rotations. My best mate ran over an IED in a BM and suffers all sorts of ongoing issues inc. PTSD. Another mate was killed by an IED two weeks after I got home. Another was shot and can't run anymore or eat some types of food. Another suffered a TBI in chopper crash and had to learn to walk again. 

From a SF perspective, some of the problems include:


operational tempo, people were doing trips without sufficient time to decompress. When you weren't deployed you were getting ready for the next deployment or on counter terrorism
culture that treated getting help as weakness, 
raising mental health issues would effect your security clearance (which was essential for your job)
lack of preventative psychology, we weren't given any tools to prepare or manage our own mental wellbeing
insufficent counselling/support, at the end of each trip you had a 5-10 min session with a psych which was basically just to assess how suicidal you were, no help with dealing the trauma people experienced, in one of mine the psych just talked about his boxing
difficulty getting DVA support, it takes years and mountains of evidence and some people suffering issues like PTSD don't have the mental capacity to fight for years
difficulty maintaining DVA support, even after a successful claim, they keep reassessing it
transitioning to civilian life, I personally felt I had good support, but I've heard a few people had massive troubles"

Does anyone seriously believe that someone getting a few hours a week should be classed as employed? That's underemployment.

Can we have stats that reflect those who have FULLTIME employment and those who don't? 

We have so many people unemployed and underemployed as a result of COVID (because it's through 'no fault of their own' and anyone else who was unemployed before that must have done something to deserve it /s). The unemployed are not even close to being the drain on the economy that this government would have anyone believe and they prop up an industry that exists (and profits from) their misfortune. 

We could get rid of employment providers (that don't provide any such thing) and pay those on pensions and unemployment benefits enough to get employed AND pay rent and eat. The disabilities community might not have to prove they haven't regrown a limb each year like they do now. There's more savings. We'd be well ahead. Get rid of the mercenary cottage industries that have sprung up around the disadvantaged and give the money direct. 

i mean, stay with me here, they may even be able to look at affording their own housing. i know it's a top level luxury reserved for those who have made all the right choices (like not having a disability /s) but it might be good for society broadly if the kids of these people have the same security of the right choosing people. They might latch on to the Australian fairy tale that meritocracy exists and if you work hard there are rewards to be had. Just thinking out aloud n stuff. 

Let's just drop the bullsh*t statistical gymnastics that applies to employment statistics and see how horrific it really is for the average Australian family. 

The reason a lot of Australians don't lose their sh*t about home loan rates is because they are irrelevant. The ability to get a loan is not viable. Put it in reach and watch the tide turn. 

Boomers had to part with a few years wage to buy a house. Now people are looking at twelve years on average last time i checked. Could be worse now.

It's so strange that we have such appalling mental health problems in the lucky country, yeah? How many different ways can a parent serve mince to a family for years on end to pay someone else's house off? Apparently a lifetime. 

And to be clear, you don't have to be one of those who are in that situation to know it is happening. It's called empathy. Our PM needs a budget of $190 000 and a coach to acquire the ability to fake such an emotion but for most of us it comes fairly naturally. It's fortunate because most of the country couldn't afford the going rate for empathy tutoring."

I'm currently a psychology student and have thought extensively about investigating the real impact of R U OK as a post graduate project. At the end of the day it's a population level approach and unfortunately anything at population level generally had small effect sizes. I think we can do better but I won't pretend I know exactly how. I've worked in drug and alcohol rehab and mental health for 5 years now and you're right, most people don't have a clue how to respond to someone not being ok. 

What would you like from your friends, family or peers? Take a step of vulnerability and tell one of them directly. Most people would love to help but simply don't know how. 95% of the population would be terrified if someone told them they were sucidal, because they feel unequipped and scared for someone they love. So it's not a response of lack of support, but more likely feeling like they can't help you. 

So tell them. ""Hey man do you mind if we hang out, I'm not doing well and don't know what to do?"", ""Could you call me on Tuesday and Friday just for a little bit, so I feel less alone, those are often my worse days"".

And then seek professional help. Go to your GP asap and get a referral for a psychologist. You can very easily gain access to 20 subsidised appointments at the moment. And then you call until you find a psychologist who can see you asap. This part is harder than usual at the moment due to covid but you have to do it. I can't express how life changing seeing one is. 

You've got this. I don't know you but I care about a random stranger enough to take the time out to write this. Be vulnerable with those close to you, they will help you, and seek professional help. Don't use hating R U OK as an excuse to do what is admittedly hard and get help."

Mental health crisis and emergency departments across the city were smashed throughout by elevated presentation.

Even with the restrictions being eased we’re only seeing a slight drop off in support demand. There’s people who’ve lost jobs, there’s lots of people who’ve lost shifts they needed to make ends meet, there is significant and real trauma dredged up from the last lockdown and there is salt poured into already existing wounds because of broader issues of isolation, be they interstate or international connections or just plain old, understandable fear.

In particular, concerns over length of these restrictions are not without grounds. There are no consistent or even explained thresholds for entering lockdowns, there are no metrics given for leaving them, and we have lived through six weeks becoming sixteen with absolutely devastating impacts to those without the financial, labour and housing security that frankly seems to be enjoyed by many of the voices loudly dismissing the concern from public platforms.

If I wanted to pinpoint an area of media bullshit, it’s the feed into alarmism over cases of COVID, in numbers that would be the envy of the world, with absolutely no exploration or even awareness that this virus sits as an additive variable on a broader public health landscape that is all too often being completely disregarded.

In this instance, with no spread unlinked from the initial leak and the last infection occurring before the lockdown even began there has not been a proper exploration of the proportionality of the response or the full extent of its consequences.

They’ve been written, but they’re sidelined because of the prevailing narrative that has been established by undue focus on raw case numbers by press and government alike to the frequent exclusion of all else.

I would add that the loud output we’ve seen from the Herald Sun is not such an exploration and they’d be far more effective were they to actually do some journalism rather than commentary.

This state should never have been allowed to become established. As we move into our vaccination phase it must be pulled down and apart, again by press and government alike, or we’re going to find ourselves unreasonably and irrationally risk adverse to the point of substantial social harm."

I know this is overly simplistic, but I want to hear from Aussies outside my circle to see if this is really the public opinion. As we know the public opinion rules what the leaders choose to do.

A vast majority of the population do not care beyond what effects them directly in the present moment. This isn't a shortcoming or an issue, it is who they are, and who they have a right to be. 

They aren't going to change from their beliefs (or very few are going to) without being directly negatively impacted (even covid wasn't enough to change the majorities opinion).

For so long I believed that the media is a manipulator and all that's needed is education. But the reality is the principles that ground the coalitions policies are deeply ingrained within the  contemporary Australian culture beyond just media influence.

Howard, Abbott, Turnbull, and Morrison paint an overwhelmingly clear picture of what our society actually is. And strives to be.

It is not what I want for the country or the world but I need for my own mental health and resilience to accept this is our identity and where we as a democracy want to head.

I don't think it's fair to just blame ""Murdoch"" despite the overwhelming influence he has. People have the right to their own opinion and political ideas irrespective of where they may come from.

Not having someone to talk to about it, not being able to put the feelings into context, not being able to forgive ourselves and give ourselves permission to escape and enjoy ourselves compound the effects of this torture.

But Australians should have been demanding more months ago.  Given the way that the government drags it's heels and takes months (sometimes years) to do anything of note; they should have been openly planning and making roll-out dates and roadmaps for opening up and really getting to the point of ""covid normal"" since march of last year. Instead they have been kicking the can down the road hoping for a vaccine to save them but in reality this vaccine seems to be one that will be needed a high uptake levels yearly to be fully effective.

I've said it before and I stick to it - unless the country as a whole is happy to spend the next decade or more with closed international borders and travel restrictions; then they need to get used to the idea that a limited amount of community spread isn't the end of the world and it's not something that should mean the screeching halt of a city of 5+ million's plans for weeks on end. 

The lack of a vaccine rollout has already impacted Australians in meaningful ways.  The lack of a proper quarantine facility has, too.  People have literally died alone without family around them. People have lost relationships and spent their life savings just trying to get home. 1/3 of people polled have said that their mental health is much worse now than pre-covid.  Old folks were denied the ability to see their families for months and months - losing potentially some of the only ""good"" days they had left.

Lack of economic opportunity has direct ties to depression, suicide, self-harm, marriage breakdown, mental health issues, poverty. 

These all cascade and cross in a comorbidity that does mean twenty years from now someone in a country town will take their life and you can trace it all the way back to the NBN not being built properly.

Giant public infrastructure saves lives but we rarely note it. We just put the sewerage system in the background. I mean, one of the greatest public health advancements of the last century was fluoridation and who'd pick that?

It's like what is the greatest health advancement ever? Probably the chemical process to fix nitrogen into fertilizer, which massively reduced starvation and likely supported about two billion extra people being in existence today.

The NBN is a massive, ongoing failure, with sharp points widely distributed over long periods of time. Australians a century from now will be harmed by that fuckup. It's like not building an electricity network, a sewerage system or hospitals.

We should be doing as much as we can to minimise this even without the pandemic. Employment and mental health is not a priority for Coalition governments. Their unemployment policy reduces mental health, devalues human capital, and downplays mental health as being a disability."

These factors might be immediate- ie the impact of isolation, the death of a loved one due to COVID, or more complex - the strain of not seeing family/long distance relationships, not having the opportunity to engage in normal activities, not to mention DV situations (very clear data here).

Meanwhile, the Government recently (pre covid)  slashed the mental health budget to nothing.

Mental health support in Australia is pathetic. Go to a GP and say you have depression and they write you a script. Want to see a psych? You can get a whopping 10 visits to a psychologist every year, if you can find a practitioner who is suitable, fits your copay budget or bothers getting back to you when you make inquiries, or pay through the nose.

I'm 38 in June. I tried to take my life 2 years ago. Went on medication after that, which made things worse. I have better results  (in terms of stability) self medicating with pot, but our wonderful government doesn't see fit to legalise that, so I have to deal with some fairly undesirable types in order to get that, and there's no consistency in strength, effects, availability or even how safe it is to get it.

To be honest, I have worse problems than my depression. The pot shuts my brain up and helps me sleep, but it also helps greatly with pain. I'm in constant physical pain that I haven't been able to find suitable treatment for. I've wasted thousands on chiro/physio in the last year with no real lasting benefit. 

I'v got MS, which compounds both the physical and mental pain (MS exacerbates depression),

I've been on two different anti depressants in the last 3 years, both of which just seem to stop having any benefit after a few months. If I could sustain the ""honeymoon effect"" as they call it, level of emotional well being I felt at the start of both of these meds, maybe that'd be enough for me to get my life in order but I am not willing to keep up the roulette wheel of medication attempts trying to find the ""right one"". The brief glimpses I've had of what I approximate neurotypical people experience (level of emotional well being) for the first 2/3 months of both anti depressants I've been on is like salt on a wound. I relate strongly to the ""I don't know how much longer I can do this"" statement for this reason, because now I have a better idea of what life COULD be like, if only.. And I only got to experience that for about 4 months of my adult life.

Every time I see stories about people killing themselves, I have to wonder, how? It's really fucking hard to do, and I feel envious of those who pull it off. Or when I see stories of seemingly happy people dying tragically from disease or something, I can't help but feel it's some kind of injustice that they had to go, when I'd willingly trade places with them.

I see a lot of of mental health and women’s health - a combination of patients self selecting and my male colleagues very “kindly” sending me their complex cases. 

I cannot see 4 patients an hour with those kinds of cases. I’m have complex patients that are routinely booked in for longer. I do poorly remunerated procedures (contraception insertion) - the Medicare rebate for an IUD insertion is less than $50 (equipment alone costs $60 per insertion and I try to keep the gap payment reasonable).  I have to get off on time to pick a child up from daycare so I cannot afford to run overtime. So my appointment book reflects this. Patients appreciate it - I have time for my patients and I rarely run late. Despite this I am flat out during the day. It’s barely manageable with private billing but there is no way I could practice like this universally bulk billing.

COVID has worsened things too, as it has for a lot of industries. Every cold means time off work with no pay (no sick leave remember). I had 2 miscarriages last year (don’t worry blergmonkeys, no live birth so no maternity leave falsely pushing my income down...) but had to work throughout both because I. Just. Couldn’t. Afford. The. Time. Off. 

Male GPs earn more than female GPs per hour. They still don’t earn a lot compared to other medical specialists and other professions with a similar level of training. Why would any medical graduate choose GP these days? Most aren’t and that will come back to bite. The government is relying on the altruism of GPs to prop up the healthcare system and provide the public with no or little out of pocket cost. 

GP practices are private businesses. Whether you like it or not, their income comes from a fee for service system. GPs need to earn a decent amount to feel that their training and costs are worth it and not burn out. Any concerns re proper funding need to be appropriately directed to the government who have continuously eroded Medicare rather than deriding GPs who choose to charge a gap. It is not on the individual GP or GP practice to absorb the costs that the government is unwilling to pay."

unlikely for those on unemployment welfare  before covid- which was from policy not  designed to sustain life longer term or maintain a ready workforce.

Centrelink classified 41% as  eligible for disability pension in the past (before 2006) so to be clear this policy is that Australian lifetime disabled not sustain life.

Welfare exclusion and lower than minimum wage for many means they will need confidence and competence to navigate living all year on
savings from income often too small to support one person during the work, let alone a family. Savings also preclude from welfare unless there is socio-economic  ability to purchase major assets, a mortgage etc..

It is bipartisan government policy to gatekeep discourage those without independent means or family willing/able to support them or established off season income from undertaking seasonal, temporary or contract work. 

Raising retirement age for lower socio economic groups still fit so likely to undertake this work if invited has put a significant dent in theoretical seasonal work pool as they must hold out for real work even if they would enjoy it. It was 60 for women. Retirement age is 60 for private retirees less likely to desire reportedly poor under minimum wage work and accept over priced compulsory housing etc.

They also seek to gate keep contract and arts work by socio-economic origin. People who may need the safety net and be entitled will have to be high functioning to  navigate Kafkaesque dystopian  preclusions to prove eligibility.

You have one example and you think that covers all the cases.  Here's mine.

We have lived abroad for the last 13 years or so, the pandemic started here, we had tickets to go home but it was only temporary so we cancelled them, did not want to take up limited spots nor do 2 weeks quarantine for a 1 month break.  Tickets were pre-booked, money has been lost.

Then we all got COVID.  Cancer surgery was postponed because the hospitals were full.  When we came out of wave 1, the surgery went ahead.  Now we're recovering from cancer surgery, but with a nice souvenir from the hospital in COVID.  The kid is down for a day or two but not too bad.  I suffer a bit, but my wife gets heart palpatations, lethargy for 6 months.

We do whatever we can to survive - our industry is struggling.  Mental health problems start to kick in, after all - it's a pandemic, we have been locked in our house except to buy essentials for over a year.

But vaccinations are on the table - so we get them all.  But the rules keep changing, we cannot plan to leave because everything is up in the air.  The mental health problems get worse - we've been through cancer, long covid, isolation.

Eventually things start to look normal - but suddenly my job disappears.  No problems, off we go.  With 3 months notice, we buy flights.  Sell most of our belongings. withdraw from the school, ready to go.

2 days before departure - bang, flights cancelled.  Vaccinated, antibody filled - but we didn't have business class.  No problems, i drain the money we'd made this year to buy business class.  Oh there's only 2 tickets - and they are to a city 2500 km away from ""home"".  Never mind, send the wife and the kid.  Got myself a ticket 2 weeks from today.

My wife and kid have quarantined in a strange city for 13 days now, all the creature comforts that we had bought and had relatives ready to send to the hotel on arrival can't make it.  No problems - let's get a courier for next day delivery.

Except the courier is fucking useless and lost all the stuff (see if you can guess which company, because we didn't do the right research because sure, we've had plenty of stress free time to do that).

So my forced 6 weeks away from my family are now up in smoke - i am expecting the next cancellation email from the airline any day now.  ""No problems, we will refund you the $15 000 AUD you spent on a one way ticket some time in the next 3 months - to a credit card that you've had to cancel because you can't leave the country with open accounts"".  I can't book another one until i get that money back, and there appear to be no flights, business or otherwise - until October.  That's going to be 4 months (+2 weeks) away from my small child, who i read to every night.

Did i mention i have no accommodation, no job, no visa?  I can renew for one more month, then i need to leave to another country - but only for 90 days, because i'll be a tourist.  Can i plan everything that far ahead?  If it takes 90 days to get the next flight (and it is likely to take longer, and then be cancelled)

People like you who say ""It's everyone else's fault"" are just sitting in a position where it hasn't happened to them.  You don't know shit - you're just sitting there with a ""Well, at least it's not me.  Here, let me list the reasons it SHOULD suck to be you"" attitude.

If you have a condition that prevents you from wearing a mask, you may wish to ask your registered health practitioner or disability care provider to issue a letter confirming this. However, this is not a requirement under the public health order.

Note that there is nothing in the gazetted health order that requires written exemptions. We don't know what was said before she started filming, but the looney stuff about getting 'woke', and changing the story from asthma to anxiety may have meant the police made an assumption that she was lying.

Yes, it is wrong for them to make any comment about filming. She is allowed to film and there is no need for them to make comments that could come across as sarcastic.

Asthma Australia has discussions on masks with asthma, and says that many asthmatics are fine with masks, as long as their asthma is under control. She didn't sound like she was having any asthma symptoms now, given how well she was talking in full sentences without breathing difficulties. But we're not doctors.

Taking the bag - probably not really something moral, but it did defuse the situation. Limited touching, no manhandling, no taser, no grabbing arms and pulling. Then walking outside the station. It isn't clear if a fine was issued, so overall that was a fairly mild outcome."

First, my sympathy to Australians. This truly sounds like a fiasco. So, here are my questions. I'd appreciate hearing your views, and think the rest of the world needs to hear them.


What, specifically, is the lockdown policy at this point?
Does the government readily provide statistics about the age-differential risk of Covid-19, or are you being told that everyone is equally in danger of getting seriously ill or dying.
Is there discussion of the second-order effects of lockdowns — businesses closing, postponed surgeries and treatments; mental health problems?  (In Canada, the media & public health officials IMO were 24/7 ""Be afraid!"" which caused a lot of anguish.)
What, specifically, is preventing the vaccine rollout? Is it lack of vaccines per se? Confusing rollout? Astrazeneca hesitancy? Lack of vaccine options?"

People are not protesting for such petty reasons as ""a mask annoys me"". Also, most people protesting are not doing so because they believe the virus is a ""hoax"".

You seem to have good intentions, but it's very clear to me you are simply repeating the superficial platitudes of the government spin narrative. 

People are protesting because the lockdowns are HARMING them. Deeply, irreparably. And in ways that many moralistic people have no idea about. 

There have been NO studies done to assess the harm of lockdown vs the harms of Covid. This is insanity - not only unscientific, but it abrogates the very basis of a free society. To live in a society where a government can - at a whim, and with NO scientific grounding - prevent you from being able to eat or house yourself - is to live in tyranny. 

Let me put a human face on this. My face. I just wrote this in response to another person here, but I'll copy and paste it here to give you just a snippet of the harms the lockdown has caused me. And I am one of tens and hundreds of thousands of Australians whose suffering is being caused by these deeply disproportionate policies >>>>

You speak about health effects of Covid, but you don't give a shit about the health effects of the lockdowns. What a coddled and privileged position you are in that your only impact has been whether or not you decide to get takeaway food.  

Do you have any comprehension of how many people's lives are being destroyed by this? I am a small business owner who has worked my entire life to create an international business that has been decimated by this.

We try to pivot, then new rules are imposed at a moment's notice. Politicians talk about support, but most people discover this is spin, and they are ""ineligible"".

Yet again, I don't know how I am going to pay rent or eat next week, and I am in crippling and increasingly debt - solely due to the lockdowns. The punches keep coming. Solely because of the government. 

In the past 18 months I have been at breaking point, called a suicide hotline for the first time in my life, I experienced homelessness and had to sleep on the floor or my business on cushions all alone, and then pretend I wasn't doing that, and that everything was normal. All because I became unable to pay my home rent due to the mandated closure of my business. There is no sympathy, no-one cares. In fact, idiots like you call US selfish.

After spending my entire life working daily towards my goals, including achieving many specialized higher degrees in my field, and creating a good life for myself and my community, this yearI was even forced to get a part time job in an industry that would shock you, because I had no other way to eat. And now that industry is closed due to lockdown. With no government support in sight.

Not everyone has a family who can lend them money. Not everyone has support. This is not about takeaway coffees for some people. This is about survival. This is about trauma inflicted by a draconian government.

Another point (there are so many I am leaving out - this is just the tip of the iceberg)...I was a sufferer of anxiety due to sexual abuse when I was younger. I spent fifteen years working hard in all kinds of therapy to heal myself. FINALLY I found myself in a place over the past five years that my condition was stabilized. Well, guess what? Since March last year, due to the instability caused by the government dictates, I now experience near daily panic attacks. Oh, but no-one cared about the impacts of health caused by lockdowns, the uptick of people with mental and physical health conditions which will be exacerbated by the government mandates. Apparently only one health metric matters, the ""Covid theatre"" metric. Everyone else is ignored. What a farce.

My story is not unique. You selfish people have no idea. I would rather get corona five times over than what I have been through.

This is the first time I've actually taken the time to express my story in a forum such as this. Actual factual analysis of the risks and dangers of Covid vs lockdowns doesn't seem to be something people like you care about, so perhaps instead you can understand things from a human level"

I just woke up so I'm not giving sources for all this but if you'd like I can post all that, I'm going off of memory for now. So there has been an increase in substance abuse as a result of lockdown. There has definetly been an effect on mental health, there's an online mental health support site and they stated theyd seen a spike in the calls they were receiving, now the (owner?) Of that site also said that this was expected and many of these people would return to their lives mostly normal afterwards, but there was an expectation that many of these new users would possibly develop long term mental health problems.

I spoke to someone else about it and they brought up this point which was valid, there has been medical professionals who've voiced concerns that due to covid, there may be people who avoid being diagnosed so we may see late cancer diagnosis. This wasn't verified, but it was a concern of theirs. I agree, unfortunately we won't know the true impact of all this, to this day we still don't know for sure even the true effects of covid. There's suspicions that covid may cause long term side effects, but we can't actually prove that till the time comes. 

I won't say you're wrong, ultimately these lockdowns may cause more harm than good. Id argue that short, quick lockdowns can ease those issues to an extent, but there's always gonna be a sacrifice."

Witness K has been handed a suspended sentence of three months imprisonment. He will not serve time behind bars.

Witness K, hidden by a wall of black panels, was asked to stand by Magistrate Glenn Theakston before being sentenced. He was ordered to be of good behaviour for a year and pay $1,000 in security.

Theakston said the Witness K’s crime was not “trivial”, but rather a “express, deliberate breach of the defendant’s obligations to maintain the secrecy of the operations of Asis”.

Witness K has faced sentencing proceedings this week for his role in exposing Australia’s bugging of Timor-Leste during 2004 negotiations to carve up oil and gas resources in the Timor Sea.

The bugging gave Australia an upper hand in the commercial negotiations. Witness K has since been praised as a hero by leaders of the impoverished nation.

The Australian government, meanwhile, signed off on his prosecution.

The court heard Witness K was now elderly, aged above 70, and was suffering physical health problems, as well as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation.

Theakston found his mental health issues were connected with his offending, and reduced his culpability.

“I can’t help but find his moral culpability is reduced,” he said.

Theakston said Witness K was not motivated by personal gain. Nor was he attempting to blackmail anyone.

The disclosures were made in affidavits intended to be used in the permanent court of arbitration, where Timor-Leste had accused Australia of negotiating in bad faith by using espionage.

Witness K, Theakston said, was acting in to achieve “justice” and had an “intention to participate in the rules-based order”."

We have one of the highest rates of net migration in the world and yet we can't seem to have a conversation about whether we should have Big Australia.

Shall we invest in ending childhood poverty? That one is about $6.60 for every $1 spent. Less mental health problems, less physical health problems, less alcoholism, less marriage breakdowns, less of most problems. Nah, fuck 'em. 

Hey, I know, how about we tackle political corruption? That has fucked many a country. Arm an ICAC with money and razor-sharp teeth? Find out who sent what emails and what deals were made to fuck the NBN. Find out why all this agricultural land bought for nothing seems to get rezoned as residential so often?

Nah. 

Can we end negative gearing? Stop reckless bank lending? Introduce the tough anti-money laundering laws? Stop people using their super to speculate in the property market? 

What, and have boomer property prices go down? You mean that house that went from $80K to $800K would come down in price? Not if I can help it sonny jim.

Can we tackle obesity with a proper sugar tax? Our people are dying. Nope.

Can we confront the fact that our largest trading partner, China, is engaging in genocide, is expansionist and is literally building islands that put them in very close range to our country?

Nah. Sell 'em another 99-year port lease! It's all good!

Urban renter here; ready to jump off a cliff because I can’t risk moving home (tldr; mental health services in city too necessary to live without + parent’s house is more than 2 hours away). And psa I do not need to be told I’m somehow doing it “wrong” - my story is far more complex than that.

And I can say with a great deal of confidence that it’s the same story everywhere. The only reason rural/remote renters have it harder is the lack of available rentals at all. In the city, rentals exist...they’re just entirely unaffordable to anyone with a below-average wage or unemployed/studying to try to fix that/still mentally broken.

There was a brief window of time (mid 2020: maybe a month) that rental prices dropped by roughly $20/week. After they all got filled, prices went back to bullshit-pre-covid-normal. So I know my rent will go up “as usual” before the end of the year which will inevitably render my ability to access my team of psychologists less “important” than needing to keep a roof over my head.

Here's the article:


Two mystery  cases of COVID-19 in Sydney’s wealthy northern beaches suburb of Palm  Beach have put the city on edge and left authorities scrambling to  identify close contacts at half a dozen northern beaches venues.  

The  new cases were a couple who did not isolate while waiting for the  results of their coronavirus tests, a breach of guidelines that has  angered health officials now tracing close contacts of the pair.  

The  woman in her 60s and the man in his 70s attended venues in Palm Beach  and Avalon on Sunday and Monday while they awaited their test results,  prompting urgent calls for people who were in the same locations to  undergo testing and isolate.  

“They  took a long time to track down,” an official familiar with the matter  but not permitted to speak publicly said, confirming the pair did not  isolate. “They’re a classic Avalon couple, divorced but living under the  same roof.”  

The two new cases came  less than a day after a Sydney airport shuttle bus driver tested  positive, becoming the first NSW local infection in a fortnight.  

The  45-year-old man from Sydney’s southwest is believed to have contracted  the virus while ferrying international aircrews to their accommodation.  

The  two unconnected cases have put health officials on high alert, with the  source of both Palm Beach infections under investigation and no links  to known cases. The Palm Beach pair visited the Coast Palm Beach Cafe,  the Avalon Bowling Club, the Sneaky Grind cafe and other local shops.  

Sneaky  Grind owner James Sledmere told The Australian he was concerned the two  mystery cases could have unknowingly sparked a “community outbreak” in  Sydney’s north. “We’re in quite a bubble so it’s very weird that it has  happened here on the northern beaches,” he said.  

Mr  Sledmere, who has worked at the cafe since 2015, said he was also  “super surprised” to receive a call from NSW Health late on Wednesday  afternoon.  

“We are a small business and  this is a small community so it’s really disappointing that we had to  close, but hopefully we can get back on our feet soon.”  

In  a statement, NSW Health said anyone who attended the venues — including  the Palm Beach female change rooms — were considered a close contact  and should get tested and isolate for 14 days, even if they received a  negative result. Other venues of concern include Woolworths Avalon, Bing  Lee Mona Vale and Oliver’s Pies at Avalon Beach.  

“Everyone  living in the northern beaches area should monitor for even the mildest  of symptoms and come forward for testing immediately if they appear,  then isolate until a negative result is received,” NSW Health said.  

It  was the second alert issued on Wednesday after NSW Health advised  people who attended a Forest Rangers FC football match in Sydney’s  southwest on Friday to consider themselves a close contact of the Sydney  Airport shuttle bus driver and get tested immediately. Health officials  have tested the shuttle bus driver’s three household contacts and are  awaiting the results.  

Health Minister  Brad Hazzard said he was “very concerned” about aircrews carrying the  virus into Australia, and had asked other premiers, chief health  officers and international airlines about requiring returning aircrews  to use hotel quarantine facilities like other travellers.  

“Our  most exposed areas are principally around our borders. We may be an  island but we’re not totally isolated from the pandemic that is raging  across the world. International aircrews are vital for NSW and indeed  Australia,” he said.  

Mr Hazzard said  with up to 3000 aircrews flying into NSW each week, significantly  exceeding any other state, the situation was “complicated”, given the  mental health considerations of aircrews flying directly between  quarantine arrangements.  

Mr Hazzard and NSW Health separately declined to comment on whether the Palm Beach pair had self-isolated at the weekend.  

Despite  the man displaying symptoms for several days before being tested, NSW  Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said testing wasn’t a “silver bullet”."

Because that is actually happening. So many small businesses especially in Auckland are just barely hanging on and are relying on the wage subsidy extension.

""Is lockdown really needed?""

Given what we know about covid now, this is a legitimate question. It doesn't mean doing nothing. We're not in a binary situation anymore. If masks reduce infection rates by 80% then if we use dividers in stores plus masks we can effectively contain the exponential growth of infections and keep things contained and keep the case numbers low enough to deal with them effectively. 

""Can people cope with this?""

Again... a completely legitimate question. If you are always worried about losing your trade or business or job... or if your wages are cut and you can't pay your rent/mortgage people start losing it. I had to talk down a suicidal friend recently... another one of my friends destroyed his office after having a total mental break. People's mental health is deteriorating. 

""Some sob story re lockdown""

People losing everything isn't a sob story. It's the reality playing out all over the world because of this pandemic and we would be better off showing some human empathy than sneering and being like ""stop crying stay home save lives!"" 

""Everything is a failure!""

The entire country sacrificed weeks of their year to endure one of the worlds strictest lockdowns and the government blew that by not testing and containing people effectively at the border. We're far from being a total failure but there are very real grievances that the public has, especially if you are in Auckland and essentially losing another month of your life because of this."

Assuming you genuinely want to learn, allergic sensitivity/reactivity can vary wildly over time due to a whole bunch of things; hormones, stress/health, environment. Asthma can flare up with menstrual cycles. Histamine and adrenaline (epinephrine) are controlled by a bunch of other stuff like dopamine and estrogen. Being in a very allergenic environment can cause you to constantly react to stuff that wouldn't normally be a problem. Allergies and the immune system are a bloody nuisance and people with severe allergies often develop new ones.

Sleep deprivation is a surefire way for me to suddenly start sneezing around my cats, for example. It also flares my asthma up. If I really overdo it, I start getting some much more obvious 'allergic' symptoms like eczema and hives that just never show up the rest of the time. Some people's bodies do not handle stress well and our immune systems go a bit... hyperactive. I don't have severe allergies, I just have a crappy immune system condition that likes to spawn off little allergy side effects as a pure stress response, which is a totally normal thing across many conditions.


there symptoms are either psychosomatic


Maybe look up the definition of 'psychosomatic' sometime. It usually means 'something is wrong but it's apparently unrelated to the symptom, the brain is throwing it out as a warning because HUMAN BODIES ARE WEIRD'. Not 'this person is imagining it'.

For example:

""in contemporary psychosomatic medicine, the term is normally restricted to those illnesses that do have a clear physical basis, but where it is believed that psychological and mental factors also play a role. "" 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine#Connotations_of_the_term_%22psychosomatic_illness%22

Why do you think so many different countries have adopted so many different approaches? Given that a large section of Europe has 're-opened', as it's being termed, despite their intimate acquaintance with the death toll of COVID-19, what do you think their reasoning for that is? I would, from an inexpert outsider's view, certainly argue that the responses in places like the USA and Brazil have been heavily tainted by politics. But Europe is home to some of the world's leading scientists and scientific institutions, and generally places a much higher emphasis on education than those countries. Angela Merkel has a doctorate in quantum chemistry. While this does not qualify her in a medical sense, do you think she, as a scientist, is ignoring the advice of scientists in loosening restrictions? Is it possible that she's taking a holistic view of societal health? 


I don't know Merkels personal feelings on the matter. Germany has a much lower number of cases per million people, however.

I would argue that Europe reopening is primarily is economic and politically based, specifically the desire for things to return to normal. However, it has resulted in a spike of cases with experts warning of a 'second wave'


Do you think that the curfew which has been in effect in Melbourne for the past six weeks and is scheduled to remain for at least six more is necessary, particularly given the CHO's remarks about it not having a medical basis, VicPol's remarks about it not being requested for enforcement, and the lack of a curfew in other countries which have successfully contained the virus?


I dont think a curfew is required. There wasn't one here. Again, I dont know the specifics of why that decision has been made. It seems to be a precautionary measure or to seem politically strong from what you have said.


Do you think it is appropraite for people who wish to question, contest or othewise examine limited aspects of Melbourne's lockdown to be lumped in with people who want to pretend that COVID isn't a threat and argue for the total end of lockdown? In particular, do you think it is helpful for such people to be labelled ""short sighted, selfish, pro virus or pro death""?


There is a strong vocal group of people who argue that there should be no measures taken to prevent the virus spread. It is those people the OP was talking about when labeling people ""short sighted, selfish, pro virus or pro death"" due to the strong evidence that taking no action would result in a worse issue.

I dont think their is a problem with genuine discussion, though.


Given that there have been a range of responses globally, from the complete lack of lockdowns in Sweden (arguably successful outside aged care although I have no doubt we could debate this), South Korea (succesful) and Taiwan (successful), to the 'weld them in their houses' response of China (succesful) and the mandatory and severe stay-at-home orders of India (unsuccesful), or the blatant disregard for health and safety of Brazil (idiotic) and the USA (idiotic), would you agree that measures can be modified for the country and situation in which they are implemented? 


Yes.


Further to that, would you agree that, for example, the experience of Barcelona, with a population of 5.5 million in an area of 102 square kilometres, who suffered somewhere in the region of 100K COVID cases and 5,700 deaths (Catalonia figures, can't immediately find exc. Barcelona figures), may not be directly correlatable to Melbourne, with a population of 4.9 million people spread across 10,000 square kilometres, with 26K cases and under 800 deaths? The population density alone is under 1% of that of Barcelona. And if you would argue that there is a correlation, why does that not also apply to the situation in South Korea, with far more comparable cases numbers, and more similar population density in Seoul (which admittedly surprised me)?


Cultural living conditions and density have a large impact on the spread of the virus and can account for the differences between cities. I dont think that should have a large impact on how a city responds; they should generally be the same. 


And as an addendum, regarding my 'grow up' comment, which you seem to have taken to heart, I would say that you have been arguing in bad faith, obfuscating where possible, deflecting and otherwise avoiding answering any of my questions directly.


I reject these claims. As I have explained above, you have misrepresented my responses. 


But the truth is that I'm tired. I'm depressed, because I'm dealing with, and trying to help where possible, friends and colleagues who are self-medicating and self-harming, who are suicidal over the fact that their livelihoods and soon very likely their homes are gone. I'm stressed, because I shut down my life, my business and everything I've worked for over the past few years in order to comply with a reasonable six week lockdown, and I know my finances can't sustain another six weeks, let alone my mental health. And I'm angry, because every time I try to look for clarification, for understanding, I'm told that I'm being selfish for even daring to think that there might be another way or some form of middle ground, despite the evidence showing that there probably is. So I lashed out, and for that I apologise.


I am very sorry to hear this. No one was planning for this and when we are forced to decide between bad and worse the end result is always at least bad. What you are probably experiencing when asking such questions is people jumping to the conclusion that you are a conspiracy theorist, which is obviously not true. 


Because being that easily offended is a sign that you might just need to grow the fuck up.

Copy and pasted from FB 

I love to hear that people are coming around to the idea that Sweden was in fact the most correct in terms of mitigation measures. The emphasis on a voluntary (rather than unprecedentedly authoritarian) approach, with the goal of quickly achieving herd immunity, is becoming more obviously the superior strategy by the day. 

This change in sentiment towards Sweden is further indicated by the increasing number of outlets suggesting this to be the case (I will attach a sample of these below). And the change in sentiment is justified by mortality rate comparisons to prior years, which show that as the weeks go on 2020 is increasingly superior to 2015 (and much the same as 2017 and 2018), as per the attached up-to-date graph.

However it takes a certain level of self-confidence (some might say ""ego"") along with a self-esteem not primarily reliant on being right, to be willing to accept that something you may have fervently believed to be true for some time, might in fact not be true.

Many - if not most - simply do not have the capacity to take that hit to their egos.

Sweden's decision to keep schools open during the pandemic resulted in no higher rate of infection among its schoolchildren than in neighbouring Finland, where schools did temporarily close, their public health agencies said in a joint report.

The report showed that severe cases of COVID-19 were very rare among both Swedish and Finnish children aged 1 to 19, with no deaths reported. A comparison of the incidence of COVID-19 in different professions suggested no increased risk for teachers.

Separate studies by Sweden's Karolinska Institutet (KI), an independent medical research institute, and the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children and Unicef, showed that Swedish children fared better than children in other countries during the pandemic, both in terms of education and mental health.

As other countries face renewed outbreaks, Sweden’s latest Covid-19 figures suggest it is rapidly bringing the virus under control.

“That Sweden has come down to these levels is very promising,” state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told reporters in Stockholm on Tuesday.

The Health Agency of Sweden says that since hitting a peak in late June, the infection rate has fallen sharply. That is amid an increase in testing over the period. “The curves are going down and the curves for the seriously ill are beginning to approach zero,” Tegnell said.

Tegnell has consistently argued that Sweden’s approach is more sustainable than the sudden lockdowns imposed elsewhere. With the risk that Covid-19 might be around for years, he says completely shutting down society is not a long-term option.

Quote: 

While the Covid-19 epidemic continues to drag on in the United States, it’s largely over in Sweden where fatalities have dropped to no more than 2 deaths per day for the last week. 

The secret of Sweden’s success is that its experts settled on a strategy that was realistic, sustainable and science-based. The intention was never to “fight” the virus which is among the most contagious infections in the last century, but to protect the old and vulnerable while allowing the young, low-risk people to circulate, contract the virus, and develop the antibodies they’d need to fight similar pathogens in the future. It’s clear now that that was the best approach. And while Sweden could still experience sporadic outbreaks that might kill another 2 to 300 people, any recurrence of the infection in the Fall or Winter will not be a dreaded “Second Wave”, but a much weaker flu-like event that will not overwhelm the public health system or kill thousands of people.

Quote (from Robert Redfield, head of the CDC in the US):

But there has been another cost that we’ve seen, particularly in high schools [in the US]. We’re seeing, sadly, far greater suicides now than we are deaths from COVID. We’re seeing far greater deaths from drug overdose that are above excess that we had as background than we are seeing the deaths from COVID. So this is why I keep coming back for the overall social being of individuals, is let’s all work together and find out how we can find common ground to get these schools open in a way that people are comfortable and their safe.

Johan Torgeby, chief executive of SEB, told the Financial Times that it had been positive that shops, banks and schools for younger children had remained open throughout the crisis. “Everything else being equal, it helps the credit quality of Swedish corporates,” Mr Torgeby said. “We have clearly seen in consumption and in forward-looking indicators that it is looking to be a less severe downturn [than in other European countries],” he added.

SEB’s assessment came as local rival Handelsbanken made its lowest credit provisions for several years in the second quarter, with losses of SKr97m, far better than the SKr1bn feared by analysts.

If lockdown was going to work anywhere it should have been Spain. Instead, yesterday it suffered the ignominy of being removed from the list of destinations from which returning UK citizens are excused from having to quarantine. A spike in new infections has led to Barcelona being put back into lockdown, with four millions residents ordered once again to remain at home for all but essential trips.

How many times does Spain want to repeat the experiment in mass imprisonment of the population before we realise there really isn’t much point in trying to suppress Covid-19 for ever after? At the end of this we may well look back and conclude the virus ended up doing what it was always going to do – kill a small but fairly consistent percentage of citizens across all countries – and that countries which attempted total suppression of the virus killed their economies for zero gain."

I'm not putting health ahead of money, it's just they're very intertwined in first world nations with free healthcare as when people lose jobs or get evicted during economic downturns the suicide and alcohol consumption goes up (especially NZ where our mental health care is fucking atrocious, i say this as someone with bipolar disorder), this isn't a new observation, it's pretty well known.

You can't deny suicides correlate very closely with economic downturns, and considering if NZ is going to lose about 2% GDP this year you can roughly assume about 1,000-2,000 extra deaths in the coming year or so due to economic reasons and only 22 from Covid (again, much better than the -6 to -8% growth sweden,usa,uk will see).

ALthough it's 100% worth it because covid could get incredibly bad incredibly fast and if nothing was done we would be looking at 40,000+ deaths not including extras from hospitals being full.

I fully agree the human experience is worth much more than some numbers by the central bank saying consumer spending is up, but it's not as simple as lockdown level 4 each time we get a coronavirus outbreak because a lot of people do experience real stress (my dad lost his job because he works in hotel industry for example, luckily my parents sold their house 2 weeks before lockdown so he's got a bit of a cushion)"

As for the government turning into an Orwellian nightmare machine where we exchange compliance for money, I think we still have a good chance to ensure National doesn't get into government at the election in October.  

But seriously, current laws don't allow the government to force individuals to undergo any medical procedure as far as I know (Mental Health Act aside), so that isn't likely at any point as far as I can see into the future. Even withholding social services like public education for the unvaccinated would be an extremely draconian step for them to take if history is anything to go by.

1080 obviously doesn't harm native birds and isn't being used to poison us, 5G obviously doesn't give us covid, vaccines obviously aren't going to be forced on people, Bill Gates isn't out to reduce the population of the world through viruses/vaccines, etc.

At the same time they reject real issues like more subtle intrusions on their rights or national threats from abroad, or they manage to mischaracterise a real issue so badly that the any semblance of truth is lost. You'll find these people hate the CCP but in the same sentence go on about Stalin and climate change, rather than human rights abuses and the infiltration of government through foreign donors, which are more complex and less exciting issues. The issues seem close but the right one never takes hold with them, yet they still feel the need to fear something about it.

We need to start treating this as a mental health issue and offering them understanding and support, because there's a good chance that most of the population has the potential to become like this if they become disaffected. It just kind of snowballs from there as they feel rejected by the popular majority and adopt more and more crazy positions on things. There's way too much ""I'm smarter than you, conspiretard dummy"" toxicity from people who should be helping them reintegrate.

The contempt that we show people when we feel they're wrong is just plain toxic.

In my experience telling them they're wrong or trying to show them how to work through it to the right outcome doesn't work. Just being supportive and letting the crazy run its course is more productive, since the reason that they're aligning with fringe thinking is because they feel rejected in some way by the majority. That can potentially BE the majority too if the opinions rejecting them are broadcast well enough through mass media. That outcome is worthy of some concern.

In short getting back to unconditional ""I'm OK, you're OK"" would go a long way toward healing a serious division in our social fabric."

I'm happy to announce that Chlöe Swarbrick has accepted an invitation to participate in an AMA on r/NewZealand tomorrow evening from 7:00PM. 

Date: Thursday 1 September 7:00PM - 8:30PM

Swarbrick is a Green MP running for the Auckland Central electorate against Labour's Helen White and National's Emma Mellow, calling for a two-ticks vote for Green (alongside fellow MP Marama Davidson who is asking for a two-ticks vote in T?maki Makaruau). 

Swarbrick is the Green's spokesperson for Drug Law Reform. This year she's calling for voters to treat drugs as a health issue rather than a criminal one, and for them to vote yes in the Cannabis legalisation and control referendum.

The COVID-19 lockdowns in NZ highlighted the poor and variable experiences of tertiary students in university-supplied accommodation. As the Tertiary Education spokesperson for the Greens, Swarbrick has started the process for an inquiry into student accommodation to seek out better regulation for students flatting at uni. 

Swarbrick is also the Green's spokesperson for Arts, Culture & Heritage, Broadcasting, Education, Local Government, Mental Health, Open and Accessible Government, Small Business and Youth.



Swarbrick has had two previous AMAs on r/NewZealand which can be found here and there.

National had an undeserved reputation as a safe pair of hands for years, becoming a de facto voting option during the awful David-Shearer-Cunliffe days when Labour was a hot mess. Now Labour wants to take that.

New Zealand voters gravitate towards centrist policy and moderation. Voters don't like big sweeping changes, and tend to shoot down referendums. This is why Ardern gets shit. She's the woman of change who has lost her backbone and doesn't want to upset the apple cart. 

Labour screwed students over, gave up on drug reform, flubbed housing projects whilst going cold on the house crisis, and hasn't done too well on child poverty or mental health either. Ardern is in her element when she is offering a sense of security, knocking it out of the park with her response to the Christchurch terror Attack and the COVID-19 pandemic. She also gets disproportionate praise overseas because other countries are starved of competent politicians let alone leadership.

Yes. Trials overseas have shown an increase in health outcomes, a massive decrease in mental illness, an increase in work participation, and a reduction in poverty. All of which would be massively beneficial to NZ.

Also, putting money that you expect to be spent into the hands of our people is one of the most certain ways to overcome the looming covid recession.

I am not a people person and sometimes when I've had a shitty day at work I google ""highest paying jobs for people with crappy people skills"" ... somehow ""economist"" always makes the list.

Gareth Morgan has a history of pushing ideas that would be an effective way to achieve a particular goal, but completely ignore the human factors involved.  e.g. He wants (or wanted) to eradicate pet cats to save our native species, but he doesn't seem to quite grasp the concept that people are attached to their cats, that pet ownership provides mental health benefits etc etc.

When he started TOP, the whole premise was that it would focus on evidence-based policy and that they were not going to play political games.  They had a very unlikable leader at the helm.  They didn't have much in the way of policy - most of it was just ""we will look at the evidence on issues and then decide"".  They weren't positioned to be good coalition partners for either major party because they considered themselves too good for politics.  The election was clearly going to be very close and TOP with Gareth Morgan running the show had no chance of appealing to 5% of voters, which has the effect of putting more people off wasting a vote on them, which makes it even harder to get 5%...

If the election had been held at the start of this year they might have had a chance.  National had an out-of-touch but not overtly evil leader.  Some Labour voters were feeling disillusioned by the government's failure to implement many of their policies - basically it felt like a choice between a party that didn't think high cost of living and income disparity were problems, and a party which did acknowledge the problems but couldn't actually achieve anything to improve it.  TOP had a more palatable leader and IMO there was room for them to squeeze in with the protest vote if they played the political game well.

And then covid happened, and triggered a big swing back towards Labour.  And National got a new leader who is the living embodiment of a cartoon supervillain, which will put some voters off parties that they think might go into coalition with them.

""But I had no idea these other issues would manifest the way they did.”

Muller says he spent the days following the announcement in bed sleeping.

Michelle adds: ""You were so sleep-deprived already.""

Muller explains: ""That's part of the healing right? Walking away from the environment and surrounding yourself with the things that matter; love and family and friends, resting, walking and just breathing.”

It was in these moments Muller began to grasp the impact his very public exit had made on others.

""I'm talking hundreds of emails, texts, lots from people I've never met before. There were quite a few emails from people saying 'Dear Todd, I'm actually a Labour supporter but ...'

Muller shares a laugh before reiterating how stunned he was at the response.

""They often saw it from a lens of courage and bravery, which I found almost humbling. I saw it through the lens of needing to do the right thing for me and my family.

""The thing that has struck me the most has been the personal response in people, and these are people I've never even met before. They come up and shake my hand and, often quite emotionally, thank me for being quite public and talk about their own journey or that of a loved one.""

Muller refers to four teenagers at Rotorua's Redwoods who called out to him one day and ""wished me all the best"".

""They thought it was amazing what I'd done,"" he said.

""I think, perhaps, that New Zealand is particularly tuned to the challenges of mental health at the moment. Covid, in particular, has amplified it I think.”

Muller says if his story can help New Zealanders to share their stories then ""I think it's fantastic"".

""The credit of that is the John Kirwans and the Mike Kings, they are a testament to that.""

Muller says he's been talking to Kirwan during these past few weeks.

""He's amazing. What he has done to take the perceived shame or reluctance of talking about it to people ... I think that's great. People are more comfortable about it.""

Muller says he suspects there will be many people who, at times, will also struggle with similar experiences like his. If there was one message he wants to relay to them, it is to ""share it"".

""Above all else ... have someone you love or care for or family or friends that you can share it with - share it. It is easier shared than bottled up alone. When you share it and the person you are with gives you back care, love, empathy, you get a sense there's a way through this.”

As tumultuous as recent months have been for Muller, he is looking forward to campaigning for another term as Bay of Plenty's MP. He is also hopeful of National ""crossing the line"" on election day as he believes the party is best placed to help guide the country through the economic impacts looming in the wake of Covid-19.

As Muller runs through local issues he'd like to see delivered, such as an A&E clinic for P?p?moa east and a secondary school for ?mokoroa, he becomes impassioned, vibrant and eager. He gestures with his hands as he talks about trying to change the Resource Management Act to speed up local development.

There is a fire in Muller's belly when talking about representing the Bay of Plenty again. But how can he reassure people he's the right choice, especially after such a high-profile fall from power?

""The sense I get is that people know me pretty well. I've been MP for six years. I live here. I'm hugely proud of this community.”

Muller says he thrives off engaging with people on a local level and was looking forward to door-knocking as part of his campaign again.

Beaming, Muller says he's ""at a really good stage"" now. And he looks it.

Would he consider becoming leader again one day?

""No.""

Michelle adds: ""Been there, got the T-shirt."""

We all need to be talking about this. Not just M?ori. Everyone. If you care so passionately about saving babies, then do something about inequality for EVERYONE. That is where it starts.

Tell the government to get fucked about poor housing, differing levels of education, terrible mental health support, and the trouble the working poor have with feeding their children and the pressure of not having enough, and definitely rally against about the racism in this country which so significantly skews our stats.

Your passion is admirable and you should use that to educate yourself, and take that knowledge to start advocating for those who cant advocate for themselves. I truly hope you do. Because that will do more for abused children in this country, than telling a stranger on the internet to get fucked will ever do.

ETA: And the time to get involved is now. With unemployment likely to move from 4% to 8% as a result of COVID, we are likely to see even more of this as families come under even more financial pressure."

I didn't click with my counsellor and would get frustrated at what I considered ""fluffy positive bullshit"", I would get so pent up whenever she'd ask me how full my fucking cup was, uuuuggggghhhh. I didn't even make it through my free 4 sessions with her. 

I tried paying for sessions privately with a number of people, same result. Eventually gave up, spiralled negatively for quite a while. Things got worse through the first covid outbreak and I eventually broke completely.

I made it back to my doctor and pretty much said the above and I must be lucky because HE GOT IT. He made it his mission to help me find someone I could work with, he supported me in having time away from work, and when he arranged for me to meet with a mental health professional through the local hospital i found someone that UNDERSTOOD ME. We've made more breakthroughs in the past few months than I have in 30 years alone. He's been talking with the psychologist at the hospital and the 3 of us are getting together this coming Monday to start down the ASD diagnosis path.

So I don't know how I have been lucky enough to find these people, however I do know it took time, and it was not right the first few attempt's. I guess my take on it is the mental health system is fucking slow and complicated and definitely needs work, however KEEP GOING BACK, don't give up on yourself.

Frankly I think those with exemptions (NZ based air crew, Maritime crew transferring to ships, diplomats etc.) pose the highest risk to NZ.

I understand that people have their reservations for going back. At Level 2.5, we should not be holding 300-person classes. They should be limited to 100.

But I don't think that the university should keep everything online from L2 onwards when we seemingly don't even have a risk. The workforce itself resumes activity in L2. If people cannot handle what the university is offering, then they aren't prepared for it, and that they, for their own sake, should withdraw. You should not be at university if you are experiencing problems with your mental health. On this occasion, I do think that the university should be obliged to provide them with a full refund with no ""DNC/Fail'' grades of the sort.

It's like the kind of jobs university is preparing you for. Once you start working and covid hits, you either halt work and stay at home, or you continue with the job and produce quality output (you're not given grade bumps for your work output).

I just don't see the point in spending $$$ for an artificial sort of learning. We're in university to learn. We're paying for this degree to receive quality education.   We should not be allowed to graduate if we did not learn as much as we should have and end up under-equipped to meet the needs of the industries which we aim to work for. If we're just going to be given constant considerations, then frankly, we're just wasting our time and money in university, and employers shouldn't think that we're as qualified as our degree suggests."

This plus the fact that most people my age are out there doing things and I’m not, triggers a more heavy depressive episode that prevents me from doing my work effectively (I’m a student). 

Lockdown was ironically a blessing for me. I no longer worried or cared about what other people were doing, because they were all stuck at home  the same as me. Everyone was just posting old photos on their Instagram. I could wake up whenever I wanted and felt super super geared up and happy to complete work from the comfort of my own home without any outside interference whatsoever. I felt almost no stress and relatively little depression while going about my daily business. It was both a more chill and productive environment at the same time. I did a whole bunch of random free online courses as well and learned some interesting stuff. Got into investing as well. To me, COVID has probably had a net decrease on my stress levels this year. 

The only thing that bothered me was doing the same boring walk around my house everyday for exercise, but that was really the only bad thing.

I agree that there are better ways to vent than going to the media, but here you are venting on social media, essentially doing the same thing as them.

We are lucky to have dodged covid in NZ which is obviously a terrible virus.

We had a perfectly timed and costly lockdown which stopped the virus (so far). So the lockdown caused the wage cuts etc, and the lockdown was caused by covid. The closed borders, however, will have an effect sometime later this year. 

Guilt isn't worth it right now.

But one thing is certain. The costs of the lockdown/pandemic will absolutely be shouldered by those who cannot work from home, who can't or don't access reddit, who work with their hands, and who have no agency at all. And these are the people that everyone should be taking about, but my view is that our leaders and our media have really missed the points you have raised.

My statement refers to my experience as a lecturer- their ability to assess holistically (complex) is superior. Their competence is equal in different ways and I never said superior. Their pharmacological knowledge however is often more broad and given the number of nurse prescribers yes often superior to the majority of ward nurses. 

All nurses are overworked. many nurses have expert skills based on speciality All nurses deserve better recognition. 

You might not like it but you do reduce their strength by saying this stuff when clearly the article is about your colleagues seeking a deserved pay rise predominantly because they are majority female. I think DHB nursss need to step carefully- their lack of support is being noticed and primary care, ages care and hospices may not rally to their call next round"

Yea. Saw the vitriol on the confessions page. OP, I feel like much of the anger directed at UoA has less to do with the inconsistency of 300 vs 100 than it does with students feeling like they're unprepared or that they should have gotten grade bumps.

I understand that people have their reservations for going back. At Level 2.5, we should not be holding 300-person classes. They should be limited to 100.

But I don't think that the university should keep everything online from L2 onwards when we seemingly don't even have a risk. The workforce itself resumes activity in L2. If people cannot handle what the university is offering, then they aren't prepared for it, and that they, for their own sake, should withdraw. You should not be at university if you are experiencing problems with your mental health. On this occasion, I do think that the university should be obliged to provide them with a full refund with no ""DNC/Fail'' grades of the sort.

It's like the kind of jobs university is preparing you for. Once you start working and covid hits, you either halt work and stay at home, or you continue with the job and produce quality output (you're not given grade bumps for your work output).

I just don't see the point in spending $$$ for an artificial sort of learning. We're in university to learn. We're paying for this degree to receive quality education. We should not be allowed to graduate if we did not learn as much as we should have and end up under-equipped to meet the needs of the industries which we aim to work for. If we're just going to be given constant considerations, then frankly, we're just wasting our time and money in university, and employers shouldn't think that we're as qualified as our degree suggests."

He didn't even front the media to release his statement and I think the voting public deserve more. In saying that, I hope he is well and that the media leaves his family alone.

Many Kiwis have already bought flights to Australia in anticipation of this bubble being opened.


Two mystery cases of COVID-19 in Sydney’s wealthy northern beaches suburb of Palm Beach have put the city on edge and left authorities scrambling to identify close contacts at half a dozen northern beaches venues.  

The new cases were a couple who did not isolate while waiting for the results of their coronavirus tests, a breach of guidelines that has angered health officials now tracing close contacts of the pair.  

The woman in her 60s and the man in his 70s attended venues in Palm Beach and Avalon on Sunday and Monday while they awaited their test results, prompting urgent calls for people who were in the same locations to undergo testing and isolate.  

“They took a long time to track down,” an official familiar with the matter but not permitted to speak publicly said, confirming the pair did not isolate. “They’re a classic Avalon couple, divorced but living under the same roof.”  

The two new cases came less than a day after a Sydney airport shuttle bus driver tested positive, becoming the first NSW local infection in a fortnight.  

The 45-year-old man from Sydney’s southwest is believed to have contracted the virus while ferrying international aircrews to their accommodation.  

The two unconnected cases have put health officials on high alert, with the source of both Palm Beach infections under investigation and no links to known cases. The Palm Beach pair visited the Coast Palm Beach Cafe, the Avalon Bowling Club, the Sneaky Grind cafe and other local shops.  

Sneaky Grind owner James Sledmere told The Australian he was concerned the two mystery cases could have unknowingly sparked a “community outbreak” in Sydney’s north. “We’re in quite a bubble so it’s very weird that it has happened here on the northern beaches,” he said.  

Mr Sledmere, who has worked at the cafe since 2015, said he was also “super surprised” to receive a call from NSW Health late on Wednesday afternoon.  

“We are a small business and this is a small community so it’s really disappointing that we had to close, but hopefully we can get back on our feet soon.”  

In a statement, NSW Health said anyone who attended the venues — including the Palm Beach female change rooms — were considered a close contact and should get tested and isolate for 14 days, even if they received a negative result. Other venues of concern include Woolworths Avalon, Bing Lee Mona Vale and Oliver’s Pies at Avalon Beach.  

“Everyone living in the northern beaches area should monitor for even the mildest of symptoms and come forward for testing immediately if they appear, then isolate until a negative result is received,” NSW Health said.  

It was the second alert issued on Wednesday after NSW Health advised people who attended a Forest Rangers FC football match in Sydney’s southwest on Friday to consider themselves a close contact of the Sydney Airport shuttle bus driver and get tested immediately. Health officials have tested the shuttle bus driver’s three household contacts and are awaiting the results.  

Health Minister Brad Hazzard said he was “very concerned” about aircrews carrying the virus into Australia, and had asked other premiers, chief health officers and international airlines about requiring returning aircrews to use hotel quarantine facilities like other travellers.  

“Our most exposed areas are principally around our borders. We may be an island but we’re not totally isolated from the pandemic that is raging across the world. International aircrews are vital for NSW and indeed Australia,” he said.  

Mr Hazzard said with up to 3000 aircrews flying into NSW each week, significantly exceeding any other state, the situation was “complicated”, given the mental health considerations of aircrews flying directly between quarantine arrangements.  

Mr Hazzard and NSW Health separately declined to comment on whether the Palm Beach pair had self-isolated at the weekend.  

Despite the man displaying symptoms for several days before being tested, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said testing wasn’t a “silver bullet”.

The main difference for me is finally not feeling as though I'm on high alert every second of every day. I feel like I can breathe and relax for the first time in nine months. I used to see the soaring cases in the U.K. and feel a permanent sense of dread every day. Constantly checking the case numbers in my city to see how nervous I should feel when doing anything. Every single conversation I had was about covid. I didn't have the capacity to think about and process anything else. Every time I left the house, I was walking in the middle of the road to avoid people. Going to the supermarket was terrifying. 

It's been so wonderful to just... catch my breath. I felt a weight lift as soon as I arrived here. And it was one I didn't really know I was carrying. I've started having conversations with my partner about things that aren't covid-related!!! We're going to spend the next three months travelling around the country because we have the freedom to do so. It still feels weird to not need to be terrified of humans. I read about the case numbers in the UK and it feels almost like the past... I don't react to them with panic. I'm concerned, of course, and worried for family members who live there, but knowing it doesn't directly affect me anymore has massively improved my mental health. If I talk about covid with anybody now it's usually a conversation around how the UK managed to get its response so wrong -- most Kiwis have been baffled by just how badly things are going there."

IF, as it seems, it is a significant health and safety risk for you (physical because COVID is bad and mental because being worried is bad) they have a legal obligation to manage it, which could include you WFH full time or coming in one day a week in off peak times. To me it seems you can WFH effectively most of the time so if that is the safest option you should push for that. I get the feeling some work places don't want to encourage it as it means handing some 'power' back to the staff and requires them to question their own ways of working.   

I looked after a team for sometime in L4/L3 and it was a little harder but I could still manage it. Used twice weekly 'check-ins' to see how they were doing and getting along with their work. as well as daily team 'coffees' to see how everyone was doing and provide a time for social stuff. It wasn't as hard as I though it would be to detect if people were down...

WFH not only reduces the risk of spreading COVID but can also be far more convenient for people. Personally I don't like it as I miss the people but some people love it. I think several studies have found working from home to be just as effective if your workplace learns to do it well and it also means you can hire a wider range of people as location isn't really important and people are attracted to flexibility."

""I never said you were arguing in favour of it lol. Can you please point out where I said that you were arguing for it?""


If your response to most of the points I raised is, ""that doesn't mean the solution is to stop the lockdown"", then I would say it's pretty reasonable to think that you're assume my argument was to stop the lockdown. If you didn't think that was my argument, then why were you changing the topic?


""Are you implying that I have cherrypicked? Because I haven't, I don't know why you would say that.""


You literally responded to the majority of my concerns wth ""that doesn't mean the solution is to stop the lockdown"", and then completely bypassed my statement in which I pointed out that I wasn't in favour of ending the lockdowns.


""There have been a huge number of conspiracy theories for ages...""


And they are becoming increasingly common, to a significant degree. Once again, I point out a potentail reason why (one of many); you dismiss this with ""People who believe in conspiracy theories are completely at fault for failing to use any sort of actual thinking skills, otherwise they wouldn't believe in stupid conspiracy theories. Or they don't like the truth"", basically proving my point. Thanks.


""I haven't dismissed anything. Can you please point out where I dismissed them?"" (re medical experts)


Your response to my mention of the comments by the Cancer Council and the spokesman for the Peter McCallum Cancer Centre was ""the solution isn't just ""end the lockdown"""". Technically correct. Also a complete dismissal of the valid concerns of these people, and literally not bringing anything new to the table.


""And the points you raised didn't come with any sort of meaningful change. What do these people propose to do about these things?""


Yeah, no kidding. This is the part of the discussion I was hoping to reach. Bear in mind my post originally was a question to someone trying to ascertain their views on the letter mentioned earlier, as a way of figuring out how that incorporated into their mindset of following the advice of authorities, at which point you once again dismissed the concerns of said authorities (minority or not, doctors are authorities on issues of health, more than assumably you or definitely I).

I don't have answers. I do think that the curfew is overly restrictive and has no proven medical basis. I think educations is a key factor, like you said. I think there may be room for incorporation of safe activities, such as outdoor exercise, into the plan rather than having people stay inside for 23 hours a day for twelve weeks of the year. What are your thoughts? Do you have any of your own, or is the solution just to not end the lockdown?


""I have done no such thing."" (re ignoring my examples)


You literally ignored my hypothetical examples of professionals in other fields speaking out, and instead substituted your own example of climate change.


""This doesn't mean that there haven't been other epidemics and research done into best practise during a global pandemic. We know what to do, doesn't mean people have actually done it""


Do we? If we did, why has their been such a wide-varying response? Is every country who didn't adopt our model run fools who are misguided by petty politics, or are there multiple models and viewpoints? Do you not think that to be a little arrogant? Are you in fact an epidemiologist, virologist, public health researcher or other? And if not, how do you know it isn't our response that's being guided by politics instead of science?

As a prime example, Victoria's CHO mentioning that there was no medical basis for a curfew. So why is it included in the lockdown for a minimum twelve weeks? Is this 'best practice'? Who exactly defiened this global consensus, where is it outlined, and most importantly, why do you think there have been so many differing approaches when the 'best practices' are oh so bleeding obvious? And how does that relate to the fact that the professor upon whose research the Victorian modelling relies described his own work as 'stochastic', meaning ""having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analysed statistically but may not be predicted precisely""?


""Refusing to acknowledge the same weak arguments which have been repeteated ad nauseam isn't an unwillingness to put my own view to the test, because they have already been tested.""


I actually said there were strong and weak arguments on both sides, yours included. Additionally, where exactly have the arguments regarding secondary effects of lockdowns on public health been tested? Can you provide any sources? I have at least provided a few. You've provided exactly none.

And I'm beginning to doubt you understand what nuance is.

Finally, my favourite.


""Of course we can debate the merits, I never said we couldn't.""


Great. That's all I was looking for in the first place. In light of this, let me codify a few questions:


Why do you think so many different countries have adopted so many different approaches? Given that a large section of Europe has 're-opened', as it's being termed, despite their intimate acquaintance with the death toll of COVID-19, what do you think their reasoning for that is? I would, from an inexpert outsider's view, certainly argue that the responses in places like the USA and Brazil have been heavily tainted by politics. But Europe is home to some of the world's leading scientists and scientific institutions, and generally places a much higher emphasis on education than those countries. Angela Merkel has a doctorate in quantum chemistry. While this does not qualify her in a medical sense, do you think she, as a scientist, is ignoring the advice of scientists in loosening restrictions? Is it possible that she's taking a holistic view of societal health? 
Do you think that the curfew which has been in effect in Melbourne for the past six weeks and is scheduled to remain for at least six more is necessary, particularly given the CHO's remarks about it not having a medical basis, VicPol's remarks about it not being requested for enforcement, and the lack of a curfew in other countries which have successfully contained the virus?
Do you think it is appropraite for people who wish to question, contest or othewise examine limited aspects of Melbourne's lockdown to be lumped in with people who want to pretend that COVID isn't a threat and argue for the total end of lockdown? In particular, do you think it is helpful for such people to be labelled ""short sighted, selfish, pro virus or pro death""?
Given that there have been a range of responses globally, from the complete lack of lockdowns in Sweden (arguably successful outside aged care although I have no doubt we could debate this), South Korea (succesful) and Taiwan (successful), to the 'weld them in their houses' response of China (succesful) and the mandatory and severe stay-at-home orders of India (unsuccesful), or the blatant disregard for health and safety of Brazil (idiotic) and the USA (idiotic), would you agree that measures can be modified for the country and situation in which they are implemented? 
Further to that, would you agree that, for example, the experience of Barcelona, with a population of 5.5 million in an area of 102 square kilometres, who suffered somewhere in the region of 100K COVID cases and 5,700 deaths (Catalonia figures, can't immediately find exc. Barcelona figures), may not be directly correlatable to Melbourne, with a population of 4.9 million people spread across 10,000 square kilometres, with 26K cases and under 800 deaths? The population density alone is under 1% of that of Barcelona. And if you would argue that there is a correlation, why does that not also apply to the situation in South Korea, with far more comparable cases numbers, and more similar population density in Seoul (which admittedly surprised me)?


This doesn't even bring into mention the state of Victoria, being roughly the size of the UK and having a population of 1.7 million outside of Melbourne, but let's not complicate things.

I'm just not sure why everyone's so keen to applaud a god damn Instagram influencer while ignoring actual experts (the multiples I quoted in my original screed) when it doesn't fit their worldview.

And as an addendum, regarding my 'grow up' comment, which you seem to have taken to heart, I would say that you have been arguing in bad faith, obfuscating where possible, deflecting and otherwise avoiding answering any of my questions directly. But the truth is that I'm tired. I'm depressed, because I'm dealing with, and trying to help where possible, friends and colleagues who are self-medicating and self-harming, who are suicidal over the fact that their livelihoods and soon very likely their homes are gone. I'm stressed, because I shut down my life, my business and everything I've worked for over the past few years in order to comply with a reasonable six week lockdown, and I know my finances can't sustain another six weeks, let alone my mental health. And I'm angry, because every time I try to look for clarification, for understanding, I'm told that I'm being selfish for even daring to think that there might be another way or some form of middle ground, despite the evidence showing that there probably is. So I lashed out, and for that I apologise.

But hey, don't take it personally. Because being that easily offended is a sign that you might just need to grow the fuck up."

No worries, my pleasure. Thanks for not assuming I'm a fuckwit ACT shill, hah.

Just to be clear, I know that it is only an anecdote, and purely my personal opinion as a random stranger on the internet.


he had to defend his constituents


Oh, absolutely fucking agree. But on that point, I would love for David to be my personal MP, he's very conscientious and from my limited experience, very hard working. I've only had the ""pleasure"" of meeting a handful of MPs - my local, Stuart Nash in Napier took the time to follow up on my concerns, even though it wasn't his portfolio. Simon Bridges was a massive dick, and couldn't care less after I drove 5 hours to see him.

RE: NIMBYism and high density housing.

I don't really have a dog in the race, but I'm getting that the argument here is that some people want high density development within the inner-city, but David, speaking on behalf of existing homeowners, would rather keep leafy suburbs as just that - suburbs?

And that his argument is that while Councils plan for extra water/sewerage, but don't take into consideration the lack of extra schooling spots?

In my opinion we should be focusing on getting people the fuck out of Auckland (and other major city centers), and make a concerted effort to spread the load across New Zealand - which incidentally seems like the general trend these days, as COVID has shown that a tonne of people can work remotely - hopefully this becomes the semi-organic trend as more and more people move to affordable housing out in the country.


Epsom residents are backing their MP David Seymour after he wrote a letter warning social housing could bring tenants with ""mental health issues"" into their suburb.


I clicked through to the article, and found the line in question:


""There is also a chance that some of the residents will have social and mental health issues who will need to have special support measures in place.""


Now, this might be a dog-whistle that I'm not attuned to (and I hate to sound like I'm constantly defending David) but I that quote genuinely sounds like it's along the same lines of ""look, if you want to build more housing, you have to build more services and infrastructure to support it"". I don't think it's a stretch to say that if someone has been homeless or come from an abusive relationship and needs government housing, they might be in a venerable space, and we should (as a society) support them with additional services.

I know that if I was living on the street hard-knock and finally got put in housing, I would certainly appreciate some ""special support measures"".

I feel like this is along the lines of old mate TOP suggesting that we should reduce feline populations to protect native birds, and then MSM taking it out of context and suggested that he was talking about the forced euthanasia of household pets?

(But maybe I'm missing something, happy to have my view changed!)


The question is, will having a base above 5% allow him to be more ambitious about pushing for affordable housing? Or will he continue to protect NIMBY interests all across the country?


Very good question, and I suppose we just have to wait and see - if in three years ACT shows their ""true colours"", I would be happy to say that I was wrong.

This is the same feeling I share with Labour holding virtually unchecked power for the next three years - I'm not unhappy that Labour won, I'm just never happy when governments have an unchecked majority... and while I'm very left-leaning, I would happily vote against Labour in three years time if they abuse this power - again, all we can do is wait and see."

Same argument, applies to both. You're leaning on pedanticism for no reason here. 


The concern is that by punishing people for admitting to breach of isolation


I get the concern. You're making absolute claims about how it would definitely be worse to enforce our laws than not to, with no evidence, just intuition because you think it might be like needle exchange programs. We have a lot of evidence showing we need laws and enforcement from 2020 or people do spread covid, so you're on the back foot with your claim enforcement would certainly be much worse for New Zealand. You haven't provided any estimate for either option and I doubt you've got them, so no idea how you'd say one's definitely worse. 


Needle exchange was to address the HIV and viral hepatitis epidemics. It focused on reducing the risk of spreading these viruses to close contacts by providing clean needles to drug users rather than hunting down people who sought access to clean needles.


Approaching problem drug use as a health issue doesn't simply reflect enforcement of drug laws, vs unenforced drug laws. Free clean needles are obviously going to be used, people don't just avoid clean needles because they don't want to get caught - using needle exchange services is beneficial directly to the user, rather than not to the user and to everyone else as is the case with covid and contact tracing. You can also be in full control of spreading HIV and Hepatitis, you aren't a massive, potentially multi million dollar issue, they are not like covid. 

Covid can and is traced, unlike HIV/hep. People who you give it to are hugely like to go to authorities, unlike heroin, etc.. Most people that show symptoms will go to the authorities because they don't want to die, creating a far higher chance of being caught for anyone who's thinking of flouting our laws. People also don't catch covid because of mental health issues, and don't need mental health treatment to break free of covid, people don't have covid for the reasons people have drug addictions. They don't spread or stay in the same way or for the same reasons.


It is probably one of the best analogies to COVID and demonstrates why a non-punitive approach reduced harm to the wider community. 


Except it completely isn't a good analogy for covid. It's a good analogy for giving lots of direct support to people who have or suspect covid, like free tests, and treating covid as a health issue, which I'm all for, and certainly an example of a non-punitive approach working for addiction issues, which covid is not. Covid isn't a mental health issue like drug addiction. Flouting isolation, not at all similar to needle exchange programs. 

People using needle exchanges aren't avoiding being caught for the same reasons, and don't have the same potential to spread harm like a plague carrier does. The potential harm to our community is many orders larger from someone not isolating and spreading covid than someone hiding their dope use or reusing needles. They also have a physical addiction causing their law breaking, whereas we don't have those to church etc. Breaking the law to feed an addiction isn't like breaking the law because you're a selfish person who wants to. 

A heroin user is going to use regardless of whether he risks 20 years in prison, because they aren't considering prison at all. A church leader isn't going to hold mass regardless of the laws, they do care about their future, and they're public facing to make things more risky. To pretend a needle drug addict's and the average kiwi's motivations and responses to how laws are enforced would be the same is wrong. 

I am absolutely pro non-punitive responses to pretty much all mental health caused issues. Choosing to flout isolation and causing millions in damage isn't that though. 


Also, the “scientific method” wasn't being discussed lol


It doesn't need to be discussed for you to know better? You're making pretty wild absolute claims and suggesting there are causal relationships where there just isn't at all. No one was asking for science, it's just that anyone versed in the sciences would know how your evidence doesn't back up the claims you're making, and wouldn't offer them as evidence in the first place, because of how they obviously don't back up the claims you're making."

Sure, fear can be dangerous. It can also keep you alive by forcing you to take appropriate measures. It's a key part of the toolbox our as a species has relied on to survive, and both too much and too little are the problem, not fear itself.

Reasonable fear recognises the actual situation and takes appropriate actions.

Both your examples are of an unreasonable fear driving people to medical inaction, and you broadly suggest that ANY fear of ANY kind is to be avoided.

That as completely unrealistic as demanding and expecting someone who is depressed to 'cheer up'.

Consider skydiving. If I choose to jump out of an airplane, I want to be to have a fearful respect of the activity at hand and take appropriate measures - quality equipment, packed properly and good training. An apathetic skydiver might not be long for this world, and we have seen in multiple cases this is also true of people who choose not to give the virus the necessary respect.

People should be feeling some fear about this disease. It merits it. They should keep it in perspective, not pretend it doesn't exist, or inflate it to the point of inaction.

If they don't fear it enough we see the the apathetic approach is what we see in nations that eschew masks, social distancing, and handwashing. Plenty of pastors who decided to put their faith in God have joined him.

If they fear it too much, we see the kinds of behaviors you discuss or, if pressed to immediate action, we see outright panic, something I've been very happy not to encounter yet.

During this time so far I've lost one particularly isolated friend to suicide here outside NZ during this pandemic, have friends personally affected by  covid deaths, and my partner has had to see medical professionals multiple times.

I'm quite aware what the issues are on both the mental health and medical sides are."

Most Doctors. Mildly ill patients being forced by employers to come in just for med certs is a waste of everybody's time.

It's also filling appointments that could be saved for patients that would actually benefit from a face-to-face consult with a GP. 

It's obviously quite different in current times, where it's worth getting a Covid test done if you do have a cold, just to be safe.

(Tldr I'm just going to go on a sad rant/ramble please feel free to ignore it I just need to get this out of my head)

I'm trans so I'm  waiting for charity funded surgery to yeet the teats (otherwise it's 20-50k + private or the 'waitlist' that just waits for you to die so they don't have to ""waste""money making lives livable for trans kiwis who need it, if you want Genital reassignment while you're still young enough to be considered for the surgery you'll likely have to go overseas and have money)

WINZ won't pay you if you have over 8k in savings so if you're trying to save up for surgery you need to be working- finding and keeping a job as a trans person can also be difficult (I've had a friend who had a contract ripped up in front of her despite being qualified because ""customers won't understand that"", or you get rejected without explanation or treated like you're being demanding. There's this societal veiw/reinforcement throughout govt agencies  of Transgender people as an unwanted and unwelcome burden or political issue rather than fellow human beings and it's reflected in our suicide and mental health stats as well as our rape and domestic violence stats 

dealing with anxiety PTSD depression and burnout after working through lockdown due to understaffing /the organisation who really should know better treating staff as a pesky cost to be minimised rather than valued assets, people all around work are getting to breaking point and leaving not being replaced so there's less and less people and more and more work and any support seems to have evaporated in favour of business as usual.

I have kinda given up on romantic relationships because dysphoria and feeling scared that if I or the other person needs help winz will tell them or me to get fucked or I could be trapped again in an abusive situation where debt or the financial inequality or being on Winz is held over my head and used to coerce me. I've been working too much to propperly maintain friendships and this just makes me feel more alone

It's been disappointing but not surprising to see some candidates when asked about funding or even banning conversion torture deflect and go ""oh we don't really know about those issues we'll have to look at the statistics"" and then they just move on and don't look at the statistics and the conversation ends and nothing gets done and you're left there feeling like you're going crazy and questioning if it's really that bad because the people in power don't seem to be losing any sleep over those dying/living in misery in the meanwhile

Kinda similar to racism/colonialism in NZ like how the TV leaders debate didn't mention anything as if it doesn't exist or matter to kiwi voters ,but a Maori trans person could probably speak better on the similarities/ differences and intersections of racism/colonialism and transphobia

I will likely die from climate change related illness/drowning/fire/famine or successfully kill myself or get murdered for being trans but regardless I don't see it being a very long life, though if I was Maori My life expectancy would be far lower and that just hurts more that the system is so unjust and accepted and that it's not considered a state of emergency that people are crammed into garages and sheds and hungry and cold and being treated like shit because of who they are I don't know how to be okay with things as they are and I feel guilty for feeling exhausted and hopeless Because covid has been handled so well here... it's just like NZ could be better if we treated inequality and racism and lack of medical and dental care and climate change as the emergencies they are"

I’m not going to speculate onto the cause of the pandemic of mental health because it’s not my area of expertise but I will speak on how the government has been going about remedying the issue/why it’s not working. 

For one, NZ only passed a bill about 2 years ago that made it so that mental health support workers received more than minimum wage for their service, despite having to have level 4 qualifications to work in the area. It’s an issue of under finding (and slight political plug here, the cannabis referendum would do a decent chunk to fix) and lack of effective treatment models. The issue is that by the time we find that kids need our help, we feel like an ambulance at the end of the cliff. Whereas we really should be developing skills and resources within our youth to have resiliency and healthy coping skills. It honestly should be a required class in schools to learn about basic life management and coping skills, taught by a counsellor. I can’t tell you the last time I used algebra, but the profound impact of having a nation of people who can handle life’s challenges with resilience and ease. I’m not perfect by any means, COVID really rattled everyone. But I stand a much greater chance of being resilient and coping better because I have had extensive training on it. 

It’s not a localised issue in NZ, either. It’s a pandemic has been building for decades with no real solution to it. And while the factors at the crux of the issue vary from country to country, the message is the same. Youth are being affected at massive rates from the social dynamics within their respective countries, and the state of the world as a whole. But the why doesn’t matter so much insofar as the it goes to getting the treatment or the “how” right. 

But changes need to come urgently and in Greer force if something is to be done about it."

Thats a good idea. Their would need to be a significant amount of independence given to any study, and commitment to making changes based on the findings.


Strengthen frontline services with a primary care navigator in every General Practice (already announced in the party's health policy)


No $$$? Whats a navigator? 


Methamphetamine addiction treatment - $63m


And now the real money. Good ol' Nats, couldn't resist adding a meth line in. Addiction treatment is something that does need more funding, but why are they proposing so much money at the bottom of the cliff and so little at the top?

Overall, some great headlines but as always the devil is in the details and the dollars."

So  sad that so many kiwis are still dying on our roads. I'm wondering how  much of this is attributable to covid response related mental health or  economic stress, or maybe CO2 buildup from people testing facemasks, and  whether and or all of these should be reported as Covid deaths.

 Oh  and the overnight 50% increase on existing Covid numbers would by their  logic probably justify another lockdown and reduce accidents next  weekend."

But it's even more complex than that. There's another question - how important is the issue you care most about? And how important are the issues represented by the parties you could select already in government? 

In my estimation, a large scale tax overhaul the likes of which TOP are advocating is the single most important societal change a government could make in our lifetimes.

Second to that is a commitment to economic incentive changes to actually address climate change. That's a problem everyone has to solve, and it will hurt, but it has to happen and soon. I like Ardern's framing of the problem - making NZ into a world leader in climate change solutions - and maybe that's a way to recoup some of the cost of doing the right thing, but I doubt the market can otherwise solve a problem it hasn't got priced in.

Everything else I care about - health system changes, mental health advocacy, infrastructure development, incentivising more skilled training - it's all relatively inconsequential. Not unimportant, just dwarfed by the importance of the first two issues. Issue #1 will define our societies stability and growth, and issue #2 has to be solved if any of us are to have happy grandchildren. 

That means, by my math, I should gladly vote blindly for anyone furthering solutions to those problems. Any amount of influence they can get matters more than anything else.

The only thing tempering that this election is the need to continue managing Covid well, and a little curiousity: Labour seem competent. They seem cognizant of where we're headed. Ardern seems to see the potential for NZ to be a moral world leader. 

It's probably too slow for my liking, but the general direction seems correct, whereas a National run by the cretins who have hung on will set us on the same route to ruin as America."

In other countries this has more than been balanced out by COVID deaths, but because NZ has mostly eliminated this virus, we haven't had this same mortality.

As a side note, I would be quite interested to see whether that has affected the suicide rate - I saw a lot of advertising during lockdown about mental health, but not so much afterwards."

We need a new normal that ensures that window is short, narrow, and easy to close. Please mask up if you have any symptoms, not just Covid, or if you're going anywhere there'll be lots of people, regardless of symptoms. Consider limiting your own travels.

Common diseases also put stress on the health system, and we may need all the capacity we have.

I live in Chch. I don't know how much of our health board dysfunction is being followed nationwide. We don't have enough capacity for our existing problems. If we get a serious outbreak...

We have a longstanding excess of mental health issues that the system is not bearing, due to the quakes and other things this decade. The rest of the country needs to be aware that they will be facing the same problem as the repercussions of Covid hit home. Our institutions need more capacity along a lot of dimensions (and we're also needing to find thousands of new jobs...).

Labour’s failure has left more and more Kiwis and their families waiting for a home, with people in some regions waiting more than 500 days for a state home.

This simply is not acceptable and we need to set targets in order to bring this number down.

We should also extend the Housing First scheme introduced by National in 2017 to help people off the streets and into stable housing, especially those with mental health issues.

The best way to address housing affordability is to build more houses and build them faster. We need a comprehensive programme underway to help make this happen.

We cannot allow unresponsive planning and slow infrastructure development to lock New Zealanders out of much-needed housing.

Labour has missed opportunities to partner with community housing providers to accelerate the development of new houses.

Fundamentally, Labour has also prioritised Government-led house building instead of resolving the underlying constraints.

The Resource Management Act (RMA) remains a major handbrake on new housing development, increasing cost and delay.

We need to keep building state houses while also increasing housing supply by repealing and replacing the RMA, making it easier for developers to bring new housing to market and working with community housing providers to increase the number of new houses.


Seem to be quite a few ideas there.

Meanwhile Labour's spokesperson is pretending they are succeeding


Our Government inherited a housing crisis. But we’re turning things around.

We stopped National’s state house sell-off, banned offshore speculators, delivered more than 3,500 new public houses, expanded the Sustaining Tenancies and Housing First programmes providing intensive support for people in need.

We introduced healthy homes standards for private rentals and banned unfair letting fees.

And there is more work to do.


Not sure what failure would look like. What's their plan though?


That’s why we acted quickly to secure over 1,000 motel units for the homeless; and we stopped tenancies from being terminated unless both parties agreed, and introduced a six-month freeze on rent increases.

We know now the potential that exists for job creation in residential construction.

That’s why after lockdown we immediately resumed building activity at all 300 public housing sites across the country; and we invested in insulating and heating 9,000 more Kiwi homes, and delivering an extra 8,000 new public and transitional homes over the next four to five years.

We protected jobs during lockdown with wage subsidies that supported more than 1.7 million New Zealanders.

Now we’re creating jobs building houses, and we’re helping people get the skills they need for these jobs through free training and apprenticeships.

All of these measures helped us to keep New Zealanders safe, while minimising the ongoing economic impact of Covid-19; and they continue to support our broader housing objectives.

Rather than overshadowing ‘normal’ election issues, I think Covid-19 has brought our biggest challenges into clear focus.

The economic impact of the pandemic will be felt widely, and we can’t fix the housing crisis overnight. But we have laid the foundations for change, and we’re on the right track.

If we want every New Zealander to have a warm, dry and safe place to call home, we have to keep moving.


Yeah they don't really have one outside the Crown Building Programme which has always been in place. They seem to only want to talk about the Covid response and aren't campaigning on any new housing policies."

I think you have lost touch with reality. This last Labour government has achieved some MASSIVE progressive wins despite being hobbled by New Zealand First. For example:


Abortion is finally legal. 
Benefits have gone up. 
As someone who was a recipient of the winter energy allowance, that translated into a gigantic quality of life improvement. 
Mental health received more funding. 
Free lunches in low decile schools. 
Started the climate commission and passed the zero carbon act. 
More funding for domestic violence initiatives. 
Laws to allow gay men to have historic convictions removed. 
Greater voting rights for prisoners. 
Massively increased tenant's rights. 
The healthy homes act. 
Action to help prevent period poverty. 
Got rid of plastic bags. 
Cancelled that 90 day trial fucking garbage. 
Increased gun control. 


That's just SOME of the things Ardern's coalition government has achieved. 

And based on how fucking moronically the rest of the world is handling COVID-19, I'd say her handling of the pandemic is pretty damn progressive. 

So ""zero percent chance"" huh. Do you think all that came from NZ First or something?


You're operating under the assumption that Jacinda Ardern is going to magically grow a backbone 


A politician without a backbone couldn't control Winston Peters as expertly as Ardern has. Ardern just made history. This is the first MMP majority, ever, since MMP was even invented. I think she's an incredibly astute politician with far reaching ambitions to change NZ for the better. Time will tell I guess, but she's already made a great start in spite of NZ First.


It's three years of tinkering around the edges

The problem that is the investment can take 20 years to show a return.

Better education will result in lower unemployment and lower crime rates.

Better primary health care means lower surgical costs.

Better environment policy means less climate change.

Better social policy means less inequality.

The real question is what do we mean by better education, better primary health care, better environment?

I think better education means more teachers, teaching how to think and not what to think. A good student will learn how to find out stuff. A focus of critical thinking, life skills like budgeting. Much of the current system is about rote learning of facts and formulas to pass a test.

I think better primary health care means lower cost or free and easy access to all health care including dental, vision (optometrist), mental health. A focus on stopping people getting sick in the first place.

I think better environment means a stop to projects that only focus on profit. Less use of oil and gas, an investment in renewable energy. An RMA that considers externalities.

A lot of these ideas will need more government investment, and post Covid we have significant government debt, the answer needs to be tax of the rich and tax on companies, People on more than $150k can afford to pay a bit more.

Growing the economy sounds nice, but we would need to grow the economy significantly above pre-covid levels and that could take 10 years.

Cutting government spending to pay down debt is exactly the wrong answer, government spending is a good way is avoid or fix a recession. And failing to invest as above will have significant negative impact in 20 years.

I only see one party who can make this happen."

Look at Europe right now. More lockdowns which will cause more damage through destroying the economy and people’s mental health than the disease itself will actually cause.

My point here is that the death rate is lower than the negative impacts on the economy and mental health. This is the balance we have to find. Don’t control the disease at all costs. Control the disease with measures which have less negative impacts than the disease itself has. So for us here in NZ, the odd lockdown so we can keep COVID out of the country and encouraging the use of contact tracing makes sense. However, forcing people to do things is a slippery slope and easily leads to people supporting stopping the disease at all costs rather than stopping the disease with measures which are less impactful than the disease itself.

For my mental health and to spend more time focusing on real world stuff.

But, before I do, I wanted to draw attention to some of the toxicity on this sub that has encouraged me to sign off. 

1) The never ending posts about housing. For the sake of your mental health, these should stop. They are all the same. ""Houses are too expensive. Investors are bad. Government don't do shit. Let's fix it all by crashing the market."" And, they always illicit the same negative depressing responses. If you want to feel better about housing in NZ  stop engaging with these posts and focus on your own situation. 

2) COVID posts. COVID sucks. We can all agree. What I don't like is all the hyperbole that's here. It's not rational. I see posts and comments saying things like ""close the borders immediately to everyone."" ""We need to lockdown now!"". ""Throw anti-vaxxers in jail"". The last one has been a particular favorite. Comments like this are ill-informed nonsense. Yet, they get high engagement on here. If someone was on the street wearing a sandwich board that said these things you'd think they were mad, yet on here people take notice of it. Again, if you want to feel better about covid, stop engaging with these people. 

3) Downvotes. I like to sort by New. I like to see the small posts that don't always make it to the front. But what I notice with these posts is an inexplicable level of downvoting. And these are often benign posts too. Today's great example is a chap who has asked about where was the best place to buy an engagement ring (good on him for getting on in life). At the time of writing this post is sitting at 0. I upvoted it, but it remains at 0. This means that 2 (but possibly more) have downvoted his post  preventing it from reaching a wider audience. And I am totally lost as to why. Who had a problem with that post (and others like it) so much so that you wanted to bury it. Is it jealousy? Do you not think such a question is appropriate here? Such behavior here feeds into the tall poppy narrative big time.

Maybe this is just me. But I doubt it. I see a lot of people on here talk about mental health. And while I'm far from mentally healthy myself, I'd suggest signing off from here as a decent first step.

LOL, reaching out to whom? Fuck every politician who uses catchy phrases like that to gain voter sympathy while doing absolutely nada or even cutting more funds!

I studied psychotherapy and am currently studying psychology with the goal to become a registered psychologist. My psychology classes are big, yet, statistically, most of us will never be able to become a reg. psych after 5-8 years of very demanding studies. Around 6 universities in NZ offer the clinical pathway and they accept between 7- 15 students annually while applicant numbers often range between 400-700. The general psych pathway is offered at fewer universities and this year they accepted 27 at my uni- which is an unusually big number. Just imagine for a minute if only less than 150 medical students nationwide would be able to enter the workforce. Mental health is not less important than physical health.

NZ needs more than 1000 psychologists now in order to somewhat meet the demand. In order to become a registered psychologist you also need to do a lengthy supervised internship but those places are scaaaaarce as they are chronically underfunded and nobody can afford to supervise psych students these days.
I don’t know much about counseling or social work education and their numbers, but I can tell you that in psychotherapy numbers are pretty bad, too. Even if the AUT program refuses to tell students the specific numbers who they will let into the registration pathway, it’s pretty bleak there, too. They usually accept not more than 13-15 people annually either into their 2-year program as they face the same problem around supervised internships.

Those few registered psychologists who made it and work in the public sector are often burnt out due to the workload. Those who switch to private practice have to turn away people ad infinitum as well. So you often can’t even buy yourself into the system despite being financially secure enough to pay 150-250$ /hr.
In the end, politicians let people deteriorate to the point of being suicidal and even then you might not receive the help you need. Some ERs had to turn away very suicidal people with a brochure about “mindfulness” as they didn’t have any beds left in the mental health unit.

Now with Covid and lockdowns, I anticipate an even more increased demand for mental health services. If you don’t find the current situation acceptable, too please consider signing Lucy McLean's peitition. (I don't know if I can post the link here but just google ""lucy mc lean petition"").

I, in the meantime, try to gather some desperately needed optimism to not throw in the towel, to invest even more years, hoping to beat the statistics and not just return to my old, better paid office job."

Long story short. I'm turning 50, covid has screwed me out of my job... but that's okay cause it mildly sucked anyways.

I've decided to apply my knowledge of the mental health system both as a client and as someone who helped others navigate it and try to do peer support work in the new year.
Has anyone on here gone down that route and if so how do they get qualified and how much is lived experience taken into account.  I am lucky that I have some savings if I need to study but obviously want to get working as soon as possible.

have no underlying health conditions 


A lot of people actually have underlying health conditions, they just don't know it. The major one is mental disorders, most people wouldn't associate as a COVID risk factor but it does increase your risk of getting sick.


random people all over the country


I believe the so-called ""people getting group 3 texts when they're not"" is a media beat-up where people simply aren't aware of their own risk factors and they claim to be perfectly healthy when they're actually not."

I am a RN and I can assure you we have definitely felt the extra pressure from covid.

In lockdown last year, we still treated everyone with respiratory symptoms like they were covid positive until they had a negative result. That means gowning up in full PPE and doing the all the necessary safety procedures that would be required with a covid positive patient. I would work, go home, pick up a bag of clean clothes from my front door that my husband left out for me, wave at my 8 month old and hubby through the window and then go over to my in laws until I would see on the news that there were no new cases. It was extremely hard on my mental health, and nursing those with covid was not easy. There is also a lot of planning and processes that go into place preparing for covid - how will we manage an influx of those needing icu? How will those who aren't covid positive be kept separate from the positive patients? How will we keep the staff separate to make sure there's no accidental exposure? Nurses are involved in those conversations. That's not even considering the impact on other parts of the health system - mental health, community, rehab...

So yes, while we have had it great compared to those overseas, and we are lucky we've not had an outbreak, it's not a completely literally zero burden on the health system and health professionals, and I think it's a bit unfair for you to say so."

Yes, they need QR codes under law and you can report them through the Unite Against Covid-19 site if they don't. 

However, it's not going to leave a massive gap in the contact tracing system if they don't - they have an alternative system, much like planes, so I don't recommend stressing out about it. If your Uber took a confirmed Covid passenger or is confirmed with Covid themselves, you will find out whether they had a QR code or not. 

Make sure you're taking care of your mental health & don't overstress."

My partner is ""B"", a Brazilian in Brazil. I'm a NZ citizen in NZ. We have been together for 2 and a half years.

The short version is that 3 days ago B was ready to board her flight from Brazil to Auckland, when at the last moment Immigration New Zealand (INZ) denied her clearance to travel, despite us having established that her visa was based on partnership to a New Zealand citizen (me) and therefore exempt from the current travel ban from high-risk countries (Brazil, India, Pakistan and PNG).



The Long Version

After nine gruelling months of applications, denials, official complaints, reapplications, and sheer perseverance, B finally got her Critical Purpose Visitor Visa (CPVV) granted by INZ. It was a long-awaited catharsis that we could finally make concrete arrangements for our future. She arranged to fly to NZ (via Brisbane, via Doha) departing Brazil May 6 and arriving just after midnight May 8 (both NZ time). We were chock-full of nerves and excitement.

When the travel ban was announced two weeks ago, we anticipated B might have trouble boarding her flight. Even though the ban said partners are exempt, B's visa didn't contain any wording to substantiate that she was my partner. So we arranged for our Case Officer (CO) to supply confirmation ahead of time, and sure enough, one week before travel, our CO sent us a statement by email asserting our partnership status. Phew. 

B organised so much for this. She need to get so many ducks lined up in a row (flights, MIQ booking, MIQ joining application, scans, tests, work deadlines, finances, taxes, insurances etc.) and this final confirmation from INZ was the last duck before pulling the trigger. With her whole life packed, B checked in at Guarulhos International Airport and handed over her tickets, passport, visa, permits, negative PCR result, and MIQ voucher. Then, to confirm the partnership characteristic of the CPVV, B supplied a clear and unequivocal statement from our CO: ""You have been granted with a CPVV on the basis of your partnership with a New Zealand Citizen.""

All cleared to travel... right? Well not quite.

The Dilemma

The airline said they must verify this document internally, i.e. from within NZ. So the airline diligently waited on hold with INZ for 40 minutes to confirm what was already confirmed in writing. It's a little ridiculous, but airlines are issued huge fines if they get it wrong, so I can kind of understand the policy. They eventually got through to a human at the NZ border team, let's call her ""M"", who looked up B's visa on the system. M said ""sorry, she doesn't meet the criteria to be considered a partner."" 

Wait. What?

The airline passed the phone to B who said hold on, there's been a mistake. Our partnership has already been confirmed, our CO confirmed it, I've got the email printed right here. M said you'll have to get in touch with your CO. B asked her how should the CO get in touch with the border team, but she couldn't answer. M was not helpful to our plight at all. Eventually B hung up and tried our CO, who is hard to reach at the best of times. Nope. Unavailable. B left phone messages and emails, but it seems it wouldn't have mattered anyway because there was no way for the CO to contact M to confirm. From what we understand, INZ has no direct line with the border team. [At this point, I still have no idea if the border team are synonymous with INZ, or if they are their own entity, but regardless, there is no transparency here. They seem to act with impunity behind a stonewall]

B was panicked. She had barely an hour left to clear up the confusion and get to the boarding gate. She abandoned the check-in desk to call me in NZ and naturally we were both freaking out. We came up with a plan to try and contact INZ again from different angles: 


1) B called INZ from Brazil; 
2) I called INZ from NZ; and
3) I roped my mum into playing phone relay with our immigration lawyer on the other phone, who then called INZ. 


All the while we were hurriedly exchanging names, digits, emails and reference numbers over scraps of paper and instant messages. At one point I'm sure we were all on hold, each of us listening to that horribly saccharine ""Edge of the World"" song, each frantic to get clearance from an official. 

With 30 minutes to go, I reached the call centre and tried to keep my cool. However, I did not keep my cool. I kind of exploded at the first person, but was then transferred to a colleague/superior. With a little more composure I requested our case be elevated to someone with authority to give clearance. 

You'd think it would be simple: Our CO sent this email, with this subject, with this time and date. Here's the phone number of the check-in desk. Just ring the number and verify we are partners so B can board the plane, holy mother of fuck. 

The guy I spoke to said he was sorry for our situation, that he didn't have authority to clear, but he would do his best to have this seen by his manager, but with 15 minutes to go there were no guarantees. Meanwhile our lawyer got through to the same manager, only to find she was in a meeting. Then it was 10 minutes to go, 5 minutes to go, 2 minutes to go. We watched helplessly as the remaining time trickled away.

My partner missed the flight.

Now what?

Eventually, the manager who was head of Henderson office (let's call her ""H"") emailed our lawyer and said the following: B's Expression of Interest (EOI) was assessed and approved on humanitarian grounds (and not partnership), and so the CPVV linked to this EOI was assessed and approved under humanitarian grounds (and not partnership).  

Now for clarity: the EOI is the precursor to the CPVV. You have to get it accepted before you can ""be invited"" to submit the full application, and this detail is kind of important. We sent 6 EOIs on partnership grounds, and when those were denied (from July to December last year), we submitted a 7th on humanitarian grounds due to health pressures (I had a bit of a mental health breakdown, but that story is for another time). This last expression of interest WAS accepted, but only after it was first denied, after we complained and after we got it reassessed. Like I say, we've been fighting for this for a long time.

This next part is a bit of a grind, but bear with me. From H's email, it appears she made the logical leap that, because the 7th EOI was accepted on humanitarian grounds, the resultant CPVV was also assessed and accepted on humanitarian grounds. 

Now this didn't make sense, for a number of reasons:


1) During the formal application process, our CO had asked us to supply evidence of my partner and I living together at our NZ address. Which we did. Why would this happen if it the visa wasn’t assessed on partnership grounds?
2) From our various calls back and forth with INZ offices and call centres during this whole fiasco, we were assured by 5 separate people at INZ that the visa was based on partnership. Twice from people at the call centre (when the ban was first announced), a third from the CO (who made a statement), and a fourth and fifth time from the call centre again (people that B and the lawyer spoke to during this last-minute frenzy). Five people. Why would this happen if the visa wasn’t assessed on partnership grounds? But moreover...
3) Our case officer -- you know, the actual person who knows our case history, assessed our application and sent us the approval -- had made a statement in writing that the visa was assessed on partnership grounds. And so I repeat: Why would this happen if the visa wasn’t assessed on partnership grounds?!!?!!?!! AHHHHHHHHHHH.


Even if were to consider the unlikely possibility that it was on humanitarian grounds, then H was essentially saying that a humanitarian-based visa should somehow give INZ less of a compelling reason to approve clearance. Which is ridiculous. But we have to put that aside, because in the moment, our only option for B getting clearance was a second official verifying the partnership.

Now, if I can be charitable to INZ for a moment, I can see that without any prior knowledge of our case, and without the fullness of information at their fingertips, someone at the Border team might have taken a cursory glance at our case notes, and it's likely they applied a interpretation different to that given by our Case Officer. I believe this is what happened: M had interpreted ""no partnership"" at the crucial moment, H backed it up, and thus they both went against what had already been established. 

But that's where my goodwill ends. We already had it writing. Like I say, all they had to do was find the previous statement and verify it. We had depended on this statement. We had pinned everything on it: our plans, our finances, our emotions, our living arrangements, our reunion after 445 days apart. 

Then H called me. 

The Call from the Manager

H repeated what she wrote in her email to our lawyer: the visa was humanitarian-based, so unfortunately that meant B couldn't travel. I said I disagreed with this assessment. We have had it confirmed verbally by 5 people from INZ that it is partnership-based. Our CO had put in writing. So at this point H looked up the CO's outgoing messages in the system, and sure enough she found the statement (asserting our partnership), and she went a little quiet (why couldn't she have done this before the flight left?!?!). 

She admitted that an error had been made. 

I asked her to redress the error by issuing something on letterhead that recognises our partnership. Sounds reasonable right? 

Not possible, she said. It was the Ministry of Health who implemented the travel ban, so I should take it up with them. 

[as an aside, I don't know why the travel ban even applies to Brazil in the first place. Yes, I'm aware it's really bad over there, but B found a report published 3rd May from which I learned of the 889 COVID-19 cases in MIQ since April last year, only FIVE were from Brazil.  Whack right? However we have to put this aside for the moment also because the fact of the matter this was about partnership.

I told H that this was not a matter for the ministry of health. If you go to their website, the ban is very clear that partners of NZ citizens are exempt. This is about partnership and it is within your authority to assert what we already know: that we are partners. 

And, given that


a mistake was made by INZ
we are suffering the consequences of that mistake; and
we have a humanitarian record of vulnerability


we anticipate that we can depend on your compassion in this instance.

At this point I honestly thought H would do the right thing. I really thought this was cut and dried. However... H doubled down. She said no. She repeated that B's visa was assessed on humanitarian grounds, not partnership (and her tone suggested that I had to just deal with it). 

I was crestfallen. We did everything right. We did nothing wrong. 

We foresaw this exact scenario playing out, took precautions to stop it from happening, and yet the Border Team still managed to find a way to destroy our reunion. It was so much work to get to this point, only to have it stripped away. 

All I could think was how can someone do that? How can anyone suddenly apply a more restrictive interpretation at the eleventh hour, overturning what had been previously established and depended upon? I don't care what kind of broad statutory powers you possess, you don't do that to your fellow human. You don't leave them scrambling until the last possible minute, only to throw them under the bus. 

I expressed words to this effect to H (though not so coherently). I said that if a mistake had happened under her management, H needs to fix this mistake. H said she would take another look at B's application and get back to us. The call ended.

The Wait

It was getting late at the airport for B. She found another flight leaving in the early hours but it seemed a connection in Doha was not going to be possible. No other flights coincided with our MIQ spot, so she left the airport, and took an Uber back to the other side of São Paulo. She then had to cancel her MIQ booking (which was like a legendary pokemon to come by in the first place) and I cancelled my flights to join her at MIQ in Auckland.

We typed up a summary of the phone call with H, and sent her a bunch of emails. We said we are stuck in Schrödinger's box of having received two contradicting decisions on our partnership. I asked that she please write a statement signed on letterhead affirming the partnership status of our visa, OR re-issue the visa stating the same. We need her to relieve this uncertainty, so that when B rebooks her flights, she will be able to board without any problems. I concluded by saying ""Can you and your management team please exercise your powers of authority and compassion to help B and I reunite with expediency and certainty. We need this finalised so we can lay our turbulent fears to rest. I know you will do the right thing. Please advise when you are able to respond.""

That was Thursday afternoon and we're still waiting to hear back. INZ have yet to resolve this and I have not been able to contact with Minister for Immigration Kris Fa'afoi or Associate Minister Phil Twyford. I recognise we're unlikely to hear anything over the weekend, but regardless, we are super anxious and we need Immigration to do what is right and without delay.

I left messages with H's answering machine and inbox throughout Friday when I decided we needed to appeal to a few more parties. I sent a long email to our MP, and I cc’d in staff at MBIE, and a few immigration advisors, government officials and media. My partner also submitted an OIR on her immigration records in preparation for submitting an official complaint, which if not resolved means we can take it to the ombudsman, but we're not counting on this as it will likely take months with no guarantee of resolution. On the plus side, someone from MBIE replied fairly quickly to say ""I have forwarded your concerns to the manager who oversees the border exception visa process for their attention and early response,"" So that's is one encouraging avenue. 

So that is where we are. Wanted to share with you lot. I'm not expecting any answers or quick fixes here, but I just wanted to say thank you for reading thus far, and for your understanding in our plight. I know we will reunite one way or another.

Wish us luck ??"

I would like to begin by saying, I enjoy my job a lot. I enjoy interacting with members of the public, I enjoy running my team and as far as I am aware, my team appreciate the unpaid, extra time, effort and lengths I go to make sure they are well looked after under my watch. This includes but is not limited to answering calls from my team members at unusual times, physically attending site when there is a major issue and having direct communication with the client when my team members are unsure about response processes. The point of this post is to notify everyone that our company is absolutely taking advantage of my team and I and have not looked out for our best interests throughout this lockdown. I speak souly for my team based at my site because I don't know what other sites are experiencing at this time. The company I work for has not provided us with any PPE since the beginning of this lockdown, has taken scheduled shifts from my team members at short notice  (3 days), has hidden sick leave hours from my casual team members and ultimately forced me (by not assisting with covering my shifts and telling me to do it myself) to attend work even after being testing for covid when I felt very ill. Personally, I find this very stressful and have tried my best to keep a straight face through it all. I have had communication with higher management once since the beginning of this lockdown and the response was very negative, we have a work vehicle onsite which is a hazard unto itself as it is poorly serviced, has flat tires and is our supplied mode of transport by the company to use on public roads. I complained about these issues and also complained about not being issued a fuel card and was absolutely silenced by management (some workers have been expected to walk 3km to complete checks and respond to emergency callouts due to there being no gas in the vehicle). I was made to feel like these issues were my fault and I had to make it work regardless. I personally belive that this situation has taken a toll on my mental health, it has caused numerous breakdowns in my personal relationships and has pushed me to ultimately post here and ask ""do I have a valid point""? Sorry for the rant. I just felt I needed to get this out in the open for my team, for myself and for the truth to known. Stay safe, take care."

This is something that might surprise a lot of people but the GPs are the main determinants of funding for the hospitals in the NHS. The GPs have a very strong influence on what hospitals have and do not have. Yes, the beauracrats also do but that usually only occurs between the gaps of the GPs priority, not the beauracrats primary priority.

This has a peculiar flow on effect where because of this hospitals often do fit the community it serves, because the GPs knows what the community needs. Of course therefore it is to a great degree captured by the nature of the GPs in the area. So if the GPs are very centrically focused on say acute care and not so concerned about something at mental health ( GPs do tend to cluster in their interest in areas ) if you do not follow the pathway of the GPs concern you may be underserved. This however tends not to be the case as GPs tend to end up dancing more in tandem with the community they serve than the hospitals, so in the long run a system driven by GPs tend to match the need of the community more than a hospital driven system.

Note, there are different NHS through the country so they have slightly different setups. 

—————————

As for which is better, I would say neither is better.

The English NHS has access to higher end tech only because they are a more prosperous country per GDP capita ( British are on the whole more productive per capita than New Zealanders ) but also they are more concentrated geographically. The Scottish NHS suffers the same problem as NZ in terms of lower access to tech but also a more scattered population ( which limits healthcare delivery )

The only true benefit NHS system has over NZ is the free GPs. 

This may be good for the patients as a whole, but this is bad for the GPs and also bad for the healthcare profession as one of the pressure valve release for healthcare professionals is the option of say going to private or leaving overseas should situation become stressful, or moving between hospitals or clinics.

Since the entire system with exception of pockets of private practices in richer areas of the country is NHS dominant ( one can say NHS monopoly ) most doctors and nurses are completely beholden to the system and both its strengths and weaknesses, goodness and flaws. 

Post pandemic the workforce is increasingly demoralised ( as there is no valve outwards ) which has paradoxically led to a flood of doctors and nurses migrating overseas, and NZ is in fact a beneficiary of this flood ( as is Australia and the USA ). The English NHS is in fact suffering more than the Scottish NHS as a lot of their health workers are in fact foreigners from either EU or the Indian subcontinent so the past few years plus Covid-19 has seen many packing their bags and leaving.

This outwards flood is not so marked from say USA ( even though mind you they are also ++++ unhappy ) as the doctors and nurses can jump between different local systems which means while hospitals may lose staff, the nation or state as a whole does not ( it is just different configuration ). There are some outward migration flow to NZ and Australia as well but nothing like the English NHS."

There is more to health than not getting Covid, mental health for example. New Zealand is a country that has a high amount of people with family that aren't in NZ, and aren't NZ citizens. Being able to plan when to have those people visit you, or you visit them, can be incredibly important for your mental health.

I'm an expat in NZ, and I can tell you that pretty much all the expats I know are starting to seriously consider leaving NZ, because they do not want to be locked in for the next 3 years with no chance to see family, or their family to see them. All of those people would be happy to vaccinate, get tested repeatedly, or follow any other sort of rules to make this happen. The utter lack of any communications on a plan is what does those peoples head in."

Long covid is an umbrella  term  for any long-term symptoms that come from covid-19. ME/CFS is one  of  the common conditions that can arise. 

ME/CFS Canadian Consensus Criteria

These are some tips for you or your loved ones should you or someone you know develop ME/CFS from covid:

- Pacing. This  is a very important strategy for stabilising or  improving your  condition. If you start early on in your illness, your  chances of improvement are even greater. Going over  your energy envelope (anything that causes PEM - post exertion malaise) risks  permanently worsening your functioning or even causing you to become a degenerative  case. This  is a good pacing guide:

Stanford PEM avoidance toolkit

This  severity scale shows where you are right now, and will help you   determine if you are worsening over time and may need to change your  pacing routine. As you can see there is a wide range of functioning, from very mild at 90% to profoundly severe at 0.5%:

Severity Scale

-  Mental health services. These are  important in learning to manage your  condition, particularly since  mental stress is a form of exertion that  can cause your physical and  cognitive symptoms to worsen.

However,  they  are NOT a treatment for ME/CFS. Unfortunately, many people with  ME/CFS  and long covid are told their symptoms are psychosomatic or are a  result  of deconditioning by mental health professionals. As a result  they push  past their energy envelope and can become permanently worse. Professionals are incentivised to show you are getting better, so they can become very pushy.

So if you are not being listened to, or you're being told to hurt yourself, please find a new professional ASAP. If your family/friend is not being listened to, be a supportive ear if you are at all able, because going through such a loss is difficult enough without being blamed for it. 

Community mental health centres in New Zealand can write notes in your medical files. If they falsely accuse you of malingering or being a hypochondriac (often they see these as the same thing) they can worsen your access to medical care permanently.

- And of course, get  vaccinated. The  vaccine reduces your chances of getting covid in the  first place, and  reduces the likelihood and severity of long-covid  symptoms if you get a  breakthrough case. Even if you believe you have a good chance of  surviving covid,  long-covid is not worth the risk to you or your  family. 

Take care everyone!"

That is BS. It's incompetence, and mismanagement by the 'slow' DHB's, especially when these 'slow' DHB's are saying they've started vaccinating group 3, but those of us in group 3 cant even make appointments, let alone get vaccinated, and get told NOT to contact the DHB or our GP's, because they're NOT READY to make appointments.

And daily we're Hipkins telling us the 'roll out' is going to plan and is % ahead of 'schedule'.


Age has nothing to do with it, if you have one of the co-morbidities then you can be group 3.


Group 3 includes over 65 year olds. Group 4 includes everyone UNDER 65.


A lot of people actually have underlying health conditions, they just don't know it. The major one is mental disorders, most people wouldn't associate as a COVID risk factor but it does increase your risk of getting sick.


This is mostly BS, how can people have underlying health conditions that apparently the DHB and their GP's know about, but the people dont????


I believe the so-called ""people getting group 3 texts when they're not"" is a media beat-up where people simply aren't aware of their own risk factors and they claim to be perfectly healthy when they're actually not.


No it wasn't a 'media beatup'. the media talked to 20 year olds and others who weren't in group 3, who got the text on June 30th. Are you really saying the media made this up?

There have been posts here in r/newzealand from under 65 year olds who received the text on June 30th who had no idea why they got it. They didn't qualify in any way for group 3 inclusion."

Despite having a property sharing agreement, with an agreement that after 2 years of owning; any one party could sell their shares to each other or it goes for sale via auction after a property valuation.

Well being a new family with little savings and having a 7 month old at the time, me and my wife decided we needed our own space considering we lived in a separate downstairs one bedroom part of the house (while he just had a gf, 2x dogs and 3 bedrooms upstairs). He told me he'd buy us out but only what we put in i.e no capital gains, just the deposit + the mortgage repayments we made in the last 2+ years.

After seeking legal advice, I bought up the property sharing agreement which was met with abuse, intimidation and threats. He also said a lot of misinformation like covid has halted the market, and the house hasn't gone up in value. This was right after the 2nd lockdown in Auckland. He refused to agree to get it valued and said even if it has, he wouldn't pay a dollar more or sell the property.  He's a builder and said it needed $50K worth of repairs such as repairing the driveway (a driveway he ripped up to fit his newly acquired boat down, and to which he told me he'd pay for cause it's for his boat). After telling him we couldn't afford that as my wife just got back to work from maternity and the covid situation as well, well he said he couldn't afford to do the renovations himself. 

Despite having all the legal arguments, he told me basically he was willing to take me to court and make sure I lost out on anything I'd ever make by giving all the money to legal fees. He would also keep us up at night by playing really loud music or getting his dogs to bark at night. 

He got my elderly father on side (my father, not his) since he's not doing too well health-wise and the whole ordeal was making him sick. So I accepted his offer of just paying us what we out in i.e no capital gains. 1 month after we moved out to live with my wife's family, he did some minor renovation and sold the house at auction which made a capital gain of over $450K. He also made around $600K capital gain from selling his other house earlier in the year.

We've moved to Christchurch and tried to make the meagre amount he gave us work but we're also finding it really difficult with house prices going up, the competitiveness at open homes and smaller/costly sections if we look at building which are also highly competitive.

Mental health wise it still completely fucks me up as it's destroyed the family dynamic between myself and my parents. I feel like a complete failure in my son's eyes as a father and provider for the family. Some nights I can't sleep, I just keep thinking about the situation and if I should have stood my ground instead of listening to his threats. It just makes me angry and depressed. It's been about a year since we moved. 

Me and my brother do not talk anymore and haven't since we moved out. He bought a lifestyle block in Kerikeri with his gf and my parents occasionally visit him while our mum dotes on him cause he pays for everything when they go up there. I should also mention he stole $40K from my father when we did the initial renovation of the house, he told me it was only $10K he got from dad, turns out it was $40K and he hasn't paid them back from the sale of the house citing he only made $100K from the sale. So everything's going well for him and his building business, while we're still struggling and I have a deep feeling that he's also after my share of the inheritance too when my parents die (based on other conversations we've had in the past).

We're in a better position than most, but I feel like we've just missed the boat down here and I don't think we'll ever own property in NZ now (or again).

I wish you luck OP, but short of a lotto win or a miracle I'm afraid we're all in the same boat."

I had a full time job, it wasn't bad at all, pay wasn't massive, but it was enough to have an OK life, but the daily grind killed it for me. Most of all, I think it was the highly corporate BS political environment that killed it. I couldn't stand dealing with a schedule full of empty meetings and then being asked why I haven't delivered xyz, to the answer being: ""you put me in 8h worth of BS meetings daily, at what time will I complete xyz?"". Also, how much some colleagues were just awful people, in general. My mental health was taking a huge toll too. After being in therapy for a while (a good therapist sure helps in defining your priorities and clarifying the options you may have, I think everyone should try therapy once in their lifetime), I decided I would go solo. I started contracting in Oct/2019. We know what happened 3 months later, but amazingly, while I had friends and ex colleagues stressed out being laid off and feeling the hit more than ever, I was... Ok? I almost feel bad saying this, but I got more contracts than I could've wished for during covid and it was sort of a catalyst for becoming more independent. Things were unstable of course. Some months it pours, some months you wonder where the hell is everybody, but I was ready for that. Put aside a reserve that can hold you and your family for the downtime periods, plan ahead and if you feel like that's the way to go, do it. It's a leap of faith in the end. You'll only know if it works for you once you do it. Also, if I wanted to go back to my previous employer or if I wanted a FT job now, I think it would even be easier - I have learned more, worked in different industries, my experience now as a contractor is more relevant in my field than it was before. I noticed HRs value that too. Build bridges and contacts. Also, consider that going solo doesn't have to be a definitive thing. If you have prepared and have enough to bail you out of a bad decision, go for it. The worst that could happen is you going back to a FT job. For me though, that thought hasn't even crossed my mind. Try to put big feelings aside, look for professional advice or help if needed, plan and give it a go for a while. Of course, all of this is anedoctal and based only on my own experience with it. Ultimately, you do you - but I reckon that more and more people are feeling this way and that signals to how much our employment systems are broken. Corporate culture sucks."

earlier this year, i forced myself to drop out of high school because of my severe clinical depression and constant suicidal ideation. it was treated as some kind of joke by our mental health institutions, so any treatment i received was delayed significantly, and my depression was only fueled by our mediocre, inflexible education system. as somebody who struggles with several mental disorders, most genetic, i find it extraordinarily difficult living in a world that was not built to cater to my needs, but only to the '''normal''' people.

it's astonishing how incompetent our government has been. all of the prime ministers in my life have been either subpar or jokes. both of our major parties are just as laughable as the ones in the states. while i do applaud ardern's initial efforts during the COVID pandemic, she has only exacerbated our housing crisis, which at this point i would call a calamity and violation of human rights (no shit). she's made countless false promises (just like every politician), and instead of investing funds in things that actually matter, she's been wasting our tax dollars on things like 'rehabilitating' gangs (which apparently has already been done twice in the past and failed). 

we have the greatest housing bubble in the world, and auckland, the city i live in, is the 4th most unaffordable city in the world. the average house here costs $1,250,000 and rising. the average income in this country is undoubtedly laughable. the average walmart cashier in the states makes almost as much ($51,848 NZD) as the average wage in new zealand ($56,160 NZD). and that's just the average wage. not the minimum.

because of the state i am in, i have turned into a very bitter person. i am sick of the evil and injustice in this world. we are too selfish, stubborn, arrogant, greedy and hateful to understand the impact we are leaving on people and this planet, whether it be inequality or the climate crisis. it sickens me to the core that people can be so careless and divisive. and i know the grass isn't greener on the other side, but that doesn't mean we can't make it that way.

i want to be grateful for the things i have. i want to be happy with where i live and what i own. i was born in a developed nation and into a middle-class family, being able to afford the privileges and luxuries that come with my upbringing. something that the majority of people don't have. but it's so fucking difficult."

Stop trying to put words in other's mouths, it just shows how stupid you're being when you have to resort to pathetic attempts like that.   

But it DOES indicate that National were increasing corruption in New Zealand, even if it hurts your widdle fweelings.   

1: Bullshit, I haven't had a single tax increase. Or are you trying to portray the yearly fuel increases (which go up with inflation) as a ""new"" tax?  

2: No shit, they aren't wizards and can't pull houses out of their asses. What the fuck were you expecting? Magic to fix a 30 year problem?  

3: That is completely due to National and their bullshit ""artificial inflation"" plan, it's the main reason EVERYTHING WENT UP.  Shit like that doesn't stop in a day genius.   

4: See above and covid, something that's been extremely well documented by every news agency in the country.   

5: At least they got pay rises for the first time in a decade. What? Do you expect labour to have a magical money tree to do everyones wishlists on their first term? Gtfoh. Shit, like repairing all the budget damage national did to EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC SERVICE takes time.   

6: National literally stripped mental health facilities to the bone while cutting over 20% of them completely, but sure, blame people who only came to power 9 years after that started happening. That's a REAL mature outlook.   

7: In the last three, they all got more funding than National gave them. How the hell did you grow to an adult and still expect a magical government money tree?

Seriously, where the fuck do you think the money actually comes from? You obviously think we have an infinite supply of ready cash. 

So far you haven't come up with a single valid point, which is completely munted considering there are good points out there but you touched on NONE of them. You have tried to blame them for the extremely well documented National failings, shit we won't be getting out from under for an entire generation.

Admittedly being a kiwi male, I didn't grow up in an environment where mental health was much of an open topic. Education around mental health was completely nonexistent when I was younger, and the more I look into it I think it might be something deeper than simply being lazy or weird like I've been convinced of for most of my life. I tried to believe that COVID and having to take nearly all of my second trimester plus exams online was what left me unmotivated. I've been struggling really hard to study and meet deadlines, even as I was sitting exams, but after reading about people's experiences and the symptoms online it feels like an unraveling epiphany regarding possible ADHD. My brain has generally felt foggy for most of my life to the point where not being able to focus on other things has left me from striving further than I probably could. I've honestly always done fairly crap in school looking back, but life in general has left me motivated enough to usually scrape by while not needing to focus on my problems too hard. Now with nothing really going on, that isn't much of an option. It's mostly on the lack of attention side, but I also find it extremely difficult to not fidget around. I was quite hyperactive as a kid too, and it took a fair amount of focus beforehand not to forget at least one item when going from one place to another. 

Of course I can't know for sure since I haven't officially been diagnosed. I'm truthfully feeling scared about posting this, but I'm more scared about bringing it up to my parents. I don't have much of a clue as to how they might react. Looking back my folks haven't ever properly talked about mental health before, and let's just say they don't always have the most progressive ideas on social issues (my stepdad once said called people who k*ll themselves cowards. 

Does anyone also have any suggestions as to go about a possible diagnoses along with other possible ideas/advice? (Hamilton based if that helps) I'm also sorry if this doesn't fit into the rules.

This is a bit of a rant on the isolation experience of myself and my family. At no point is this political but an opinion and a bit of a rant at what to me feels absolutely senseless. 

My partner was exposed to COVID 19 on the 24-26th of January and we were pushed into home isolation. My partner tested positive on the 28th, on the same day myself and our daughter tested negative. 

We were in contact with the support authorities and things were going okay for a few days. 

As my partners symptoms worsened we were promised support, and assistance with medication. They were supposed to send a heart rate monitor and oximeter once she was positive. That never arrived. I was running out of my anti depressants and we needed paracetamol and asked for assistance as they had offered but, nobody was able to assist. My mother thankfully extended her lunch break to be able to get us medication delivered. 

On to the grocery shopping, countdown doesn’t deliver to our address, but we could do click and collect shopping, however none of us were allowed to collect it. Once again my extended family were able to drop everything and assist us. 

After many calls of clinicians talking and asking about my partners blood oxygen and heart rate we kept explaining that the oximeter had never arrived. 

My partners symptoms have just cleared up from Wednesday onwards and is due for release tomorrow. The oximeter finally arrived on Thursday. They’re still meant to be checking in on us daily, however nobody’s been in contact with us since Monday. 

Now for myself and my three year old. We’ve been tested 4 times and returned negative tests all 4 times. We still need to isolate for 9 more days, and return 2 more negative tests. Honestly I can’t cope anymore as not being able to leave our property is not allowed and the cabin fever is running rife. 

I know this story isn’t the most exciting to read, however I find it utterly frustrating that they managed our bubble so wrong, and I also find it frustrating that the fastest way out, is for everyone just to get sick. The toll this has taken on our families mental health alone has been taxing. We did our part, got vaccinated and it seems to have reduced the contagious nature of Omicron with my partner. Yet my daughter and I are being punished for being healthy and fine."

Firstly, I hope things are as good as they can be for you right now.

I wanted to ask you for your opinions and thoughts about a research paper I want to conduct. 

The working title would be:
An analysis of the response to the covid-19 pandemic in New Zealand

Questions that I want answered:
1. Why was the 1st major lockdown effective and the 2nd has not been?
2. What has been done to prepare to additional variants of covid-19? 
3. Why did we secure the vaccine quite late after we exited our first lockdown? (1st order was in December) 
4. Why did we only secure one type of vaccine at first? (Pfizer) 
5. How has the economy behaved during the covid pandemic in NZ (three periods: 1st major lockdown, out of lockdown, 2nd major lockdown)
6. How has mental health been affected during the covid pandemic? (Looking at therapy numbers, suicide numbers, etc.) 
7. How have lockdown breaches been handled? 
8. How has the government allocated funds during the covid pandemic? 
9. During the 2nd major lockdown how many of those infected with covid 19 were vaccinated? 

What questions do you want answered or what are your thoughts on some of the questions?

If you’re interested, I want to do this as I haven’t been paying the best attention to the messages from the government and media. This is partly because I do not trust that messages from the media will be impartial - which is a bit conspiracy theorist of me to say but I’d prefer to get my information elsewhere and not through a filter. Hence why I want to do this research project. 

Another reason why I want to do this is I believe the government could’ve done a better job in preparing for the delta variant. As I never saw anything being done during the ‘break’ we had from lockdowns to improve our healthcare system. I believe this is the main reason why we need lockdowns - as our healthcare system would not be able to cope with the number of cases of covid there would be if we didn’t have lockdowns. Also, given a few recent posts I have seen on here and r/Auckland, the hospitals already seem overburdened with people that don’t even have covid. I believe work is being done on this now but I don’t understand why this wasn’t a priority before. 

Anyway before I continue ranting my thoughts, any of your opinions on these points would be interesting to read. 

Cheers, 
A guy who just wants to get on with life"

They don't have a fucking clue.  Winston handed them the first election, Covid and the mosque massacre handed them the second.   They are, without a doubt, the worst govenrment this country has ever had.  Every single policy seems geared to only enhance their international profile while the average kiwi just has to keep sucking it up to try and get by.

Crime is up, poor health statistics are up, mental health statistics are worse, we have more gun crime than I can ever remember, house prices are skyrocketing, compliance costs are through the roof, rental stock availability is plummeting, Inflation is up, the cost of food production is up, taxes have increased (you can call them levy's or fees, but they're taxes), ombudsman requests for information are spiking, because the 'most open and transparent' government ever is playing dodgeball with official information requests.

How are this government still ahead in the polls??"

Clearly, they’re too stupid, selfish, and impatient to join the rest of the team and follow the rules so that they can beat the virus and minimise the loss of life. How are they comfortable putting so many lives at risk just so they can go to the pub? Are they really evil and selfish people that deserve all the hatred we have for them? No. They’re not. They’re just people just like you and me, led to believe something different from you. They aren’t even selfish, believe it or not. All they want is the best thing for their country, just like everyone does.

So then, what is the justification for all the violence? The answer is they genuinely believe that a lockdown is more detrimental to the overall wellbeing of their country than violent protests and letting the virus spread uncontrolled. Clearly there are pros and cons to both sides, so let’s think about it.

In NZ, if we went straight back to alert level 1 today, the community case numbers would skyrocket. Nightclubs, festivals, restaurants, weddings, and other high-capacity venues would go ahead. There would be many “superspreader” events. There’s a high chance you, your family, and your friends would contract the virus. Somewhere in the very rough ballpark of 1 in every 1,000 to 10,000 people under the age of 50 will die once they contract the virus (99.9%+ survival rate)\1])\2]). From there the infection fatality rate grows exponentially with age\3]). The 80+ age group IFR will be somewhere around 2% to 10%, depending on vaccination effectiveness. Many, many more people will become seriously ill.

That sounds bad, and it is. There will be a lot of death, pain, and suffering. However, it is important to keep in mind that although it’s a potentially depressing thought, every single of one us is already terminally ill, i.e. we only have a finite number of years left. The vast majority (around 2/3)\4]) of the population that would die due to the virus are in the 80+ age bracket, and so would have the least number of years stolen from them. I am not saying this makes it all right. It would be horrific, but thankfully nowhere near as horrific as if the infection fatality rate was constant across all age groups.

So isn’t it obvious we should sacrifice a bit of freedom to minimise the shortening of lives and suffering for so many people? We need to consider the consequences a prolonged lockdown has on our country. A shockingly large number of people haven’t thought about consequences any further than the inconvenience on people’s lives, the alleged mysterious effect to the “economy”, and most significantly, not being able to get KFC. This is a grave mistake.

Lockdown has an enormous toll on mental health.\5])\6]) Human beings are social animals, and most don’t fare well with long-term isolation. Many people who live alone that would regularly see friends and family and socialise in other ways (sports, bands, etc.) either can’t at all or are severely restricted in their ability to do so. This can have a devastating effect on mental health, and I personally know a few people struggling to cope. Of those who don’t live alone, many are trapped in physically unsafe or psychologically damaging environments. The solution isn’t always as simple as moving out, because many don’t have the means or the strength to do so. This level of mass restriction on freedom is quite extraordinary and unnatural. The restrictions on socialisation impact the formation and maintenance of relationships, as well as ends marriages.\7])\8]) Education across all levels has been severely affected. Many universities couldn’t work with the uncertainty of lockdown and so have been essentially in online learning mode for coming up to 2 years. Valuable research has been disrupted. Many secondary school children haven’t attended any kind of online classes, and those who do are still deprived of a proper, much more effective education.\9]) The education of this generation of school children is being stunted, which will have long-lasting effects. I won’t get into the effects on the economy because I don’t know what I’m talking about, but we can assure ourselves it will be negative. The government can produce as much money as it needs, but with less work, there will be less growth which will eventually lead to real-world effects we will have to endure.

I’m not advocating for either side. I just hate to see so many people dismissed as stupid and selfish without further thought for what they might be fighting for. Weigh up and consider as many consequences as you can, then decide for yourself what you think we should do. The government works in the interests of the people. The only thing they want is to be re-elected. If the majority decides it’s time to start easing restrictions, they will."

 Kind of ridiculous to be asking reddit for but here we are.

Recently I've been really struggling with suicidal thoughts (hence all my postings at like 4 in the morning) and I really don't know what to do. There are two kind of strategies I've read online- mental health treatment and changing your life circumstances- but none of them seem to work in a new zealand context.

I've been to a GP trying to get a referral for mental health treatment, I was just fobbed off and told I was not serious and there is a multiyear wait. I can't afford private treatment and I don't know any way to access treatment otherwise. I've tried ringing those numbers people always post and couldn't get through but even if I could talking on the phone triggers my worst depression anyway- I need face to face talk.

As for changing my life circumstances- I don't think that is possible in NZ. I've done everything ""correct""- I have degrees and experience in financial modelling and coding, have published research at 20-but can't earn anything close to a comfortable wage and have little job choice- if I could move overseas I could easily switch to a better job (I have had offers) but I can't due to COVID. NZ in general so small can't even find a date even though I'm pretty cute (hahaha).

I'm just struggling and every day is harder than the last and everyday may be my last, it's so difficult, so I just want someone who has gone through suicidal thoughts in NZ, how did you get better- what can I do because I'm very scared."

The labor government not releasing mental health reports, despite unfortunately increasing  suicide rates

Not addressing obesity issues.

Not addressing the supermarket duopoly... I could go on.

Doing what I'm good at and have around 20 years of experience in. Great people, good money, good hours, couldn't have asked for better.

Thing is, the business is owned by a family. Parents had retired and son took over a few years back. He's a good sort. No complaints there.  But as they've got busier lately the dad's been helping too (a bit set in his ways but knows his stuff) and the mum... here's the problem.  See, at the start I was needing a bit of help as their systems were quite archaic and my predecessor (more family) had made a complete mess of their files. So she came in when I asked for help.

BUT... she micromanages, doesn't follow procedures and while she can be nice at times I've come to keeping a tally of random shit she'd hen-peck me for. Colleague (another outsider) observed to me that she was getting unreasonable so I don't feel it's all in my head.

Came to a head yesterday after she literally yelled at me (not the first time) after she'd stepped uninvited into an email conversation between myself and a client, saying ""I've already dealt with that, you're making us look like a bunch of f...k-ups"".

Unprofessional language aside, I had been following procedure and had not done wrong. However,  this woman yells at me like I'm a misbehaving teenager. I'm not good with conflict and tend to try and appease whenever I've been on the receiving end of abuse.
I calmly finished my tasks, tears streaming, gathered my bag and coat, and (face red and snotty) let non-family colleague know I was going home as I didn't feel well. (SHE was nowhere to be seen).
I cried all the way home, spent the rest of the day cold and trembling under my duvet. (I used to get anxiety attacks but hadn't had them for years... now resumed).

With my husband's (calm and measured) help I drafted a message to boss about the situation. He's currently on the road so wasn't there. Had been dreading today but was hit by another damn anxiety attack this morning. Duvet fort again. Husband messaged boss, advised am taking mental health day. Suggested meeting later in weekend to discuss how to move forward. Yet to hear back.

What the hell do I do?
I love the work, the location, everything except this one angry dissatisfied toxic person who sees me as a personal scapegoat."

No. Delivering on promises doesn't lose elections. Making promises and failing to deliver does.

We're in year 4. Not one of these things have improved, in fact all of them got significantly worse (except the allowance, that stayed the same).

Labour has a lot of political capital right now and the only reason for that is how they've handled covid. They have to use that political capital.

Medicare is great - free GP visits. Health insurance covers many pre-existing conditions (NZ HI does not), i feel healthcare in general is much better including their mental health system. Education is same price if not slightly cheaper (commonwealth supported places if you have decent grades) so future study is accessible, i got a lot of cheap covid sponsored courses which was a real privilege. Wages are higher, conditions are better, but people seem to work more efficiently at work so maybe that's how it's sustainable.  Food is cheaper and year round summer fruits.

But I'm in group 4. Should I be going to my GP and asking them to correct it, or is it already correct? I thought they had access to all my health history.

I'm a bit worried because if I catch it I probably will actually die and the government keeps negligently opening ""bubbles"" to support businesses that have nothing to do with me."

Recently I've been really struggling with suicidal thoughts (hence all my postings at like 4 in the morning) and I really don't know what to do.  There are two kind of strategies I've read online- mental health treatment and changing your life circumstances- but none of them seem to work in a new zealand context.

I've been to a GP trying to get a referral for mental health treatment, I was just fobbed off and told I was not serious and there is a multiyear wait.  I can't afford private treatment and I don't know any way to access treatment otherwise.  I've tried ringing those numbers people always post and couldn't get through but even if I could talking on the phone triggers my worst depression anyway- I need face to face talk.

As for changing my life circumstances- I don't think that is possible in NZ.  I've done everything ""correct""- I have degrees and experience in financial modelling and coding, have published research at 20-but can't earn anything close to a comfortable wage and have little job choice- if I could move overseas I could easily switch to a better job (I have had offers) but I can't due to COVID.  NZ in general so small can't even find a date even though I'm pretty cute (hahaha).

I'm just struggling and every day is harder than the last and everyday may be my last, it's so difficult, so I just want someone who has gone through suicidal thoughts in NZ, how did you get better- what can I do because I'm very scared."

They have used many examples of where under our current government we have adopted UN mandates that many other free western countries have refused to adopt from Covid implementation through to funding the UN.

Most of it I have always found to be not as a clear cut as the authors claim.  However the announcement over the weekend from the government that we will be quadrupling our financial commitment to the UN climate change programme from 300 million over 4 years to 1.3 billion is absurd.

To start with we represent .006% of the worlds population, however Ms Ardern see’s fit that we contribute 1.3% of the total UN climate change fund.

Our national GDP represents 0.16% of the worlds GDP and again we are now committed to 1.3% of the total world funding for the UN on climate change.

The UN is a  well known black hole that money just disappears into, with virtually no way of accounting for where the money disappears to.

We cant even get our government to tell us why 1.5 billion has disappeared into mental health for only 5 new hospital beds for that sector.

Our national debt has over doubled in the 4 years Ms Ardern has been in power, we are borrowing a billion dollars a week. We are losing critical staff in a number of industries daily, particularly in the medical field, apparently due to underfunding, and we have a leader who thinks giving this money to the UN, is better than trying to keep desperately needed health professionals here in NZ.

We need to wake up NZ, and start holding our governments to account, before we wake up one morning to discover we now have nothing that we own any longer.

I am not advocating for National, Labour, greens or ACT, i am coming to the conclusion that all of them are nothing more than parasites."

My wife and I are considering moving to NZ permanently on work visas. We currently live down south on the east coast of the US. What attracts us most about NZ are things like the work culture, health care, the insanely high statistics on things like quality of living, the country's relative isolation, and the kindness of the average person (relative to the US, at least).

We're both in our mid 30's. She's a teacher and I'm a software engineer. Neither of us like the cold that much so we'd probably stay away from the more mountainous regions. We'd prefer to live somewhere it doesn't get much colder than 10C. Other than that my only hard requirement is to live somewhere with fast internet. I've read a bit about Chorus Fibre and on the surface they seem to have good coverage in places there are software jobs (Auckland, Hamilton, and Tauranga from what I've looked at so far). Teachers appear to be in demand everywhere.

I'd like to stay away from Auckland if possible since working somewhere else improves our Expression of Interest scores on our application. 

Probably my biggest concern is the legality of cannabis. I'm a medical user though my use is not eligible under current NZ law (I use for mental health). I'm also undergoing other treatment and therapy so it's possible by the time our theoretical visas are approved and we move I won't need it anymore. But it's currently part of my lifestyle so I'd like to get opinions of how the legalization movement is going. I've read about the 2020 referendum but not much else.

We're hoping covid restrictions will be relaxed sometime over the next year so we can come on a long term visit to see how we like being there rather than fighting jet lag while trying to absorb touristy stuff. I assume the best place to do that would be close to wherever we're considering living, but if there are other places we should see on a long term stay please let us know!

Thanks in advance!"

Wouldnt you want an outcome where fewer people die?


Of course. I'd like a Ferrari and millions of dollars, but they're not realistically going to happen. Me arguing 'I'd like a Ferrari!!' isn't very value-add to the debate. 

I'm all for arguing for outcomes where fewer people die but they've got to be practical, realistic solutions with a likelihood of succeeding. 


You dont get why someone would want things to be better rather than shrugging their shoulders and going ""well I guess this is fine""? 


As above. Of course I get that. Not suggesting anyone should shrug shoulders, rather advocate for policies that are viable, realistic and stand the chance of political success. Otherwise it's pointless.


Accepting it's unlikely to happen isnt the same as saying its doomed to fail.


Fair enough but you're unlikely to get anyone to buy into your argument if you yourself accept it's unlikely to succeed. E.g. me in this case. Just a bit of constructive feedback. I don't imagine many politicians or companies would start a campaign on the basis of 'our product/policies probably won't succeed - but buy our products or vote for us anyway!'.


we just dont know enough yet to make such big decisions about quarratine restrictions, that's just how it is.


I agree with you on that.


I never said it made people mass murderers? 


Fair point, you didn't.


I'm certainly not arguing point blank that people are immoral for wanting things to go back to normal either? 


You literally criticised me for going to a friend's wedding and implied that people would die as a result!! 

A massive undertone of your comments has been a moralistic criticism/judgement of people living their lives while covid continues to exist. Do you honestly believe you haven't criticised people for resuming certain normal life activities? 

If that wasn't your intention then fair enough, I apologise, but that's the impression it conveys. 

In terms of people taking it more seriously I agree. I don't know what I could do to take it more seriously while at the same time striking that balance of returning to life and improved mental health. Doomscrolling covid news has consumed far too much of my life and my friends/family tease me for how seriously I've taken it!

Out of curiosity are you an Intuitive on Myers Briggs?"

Elimination is now not achievable and at what costs to people mental health and businesses? We may think we are eliminating it but because borders and MIQ in swing it will happen again and put us back to square one and the team of 5 million will no longer be the team of 5 million!

Only strategy is to get vaccinated so we don't get hospitalised (https://www.newsroom.co.nz/delta-outbreak-four-in-five-cases-unvaccinated) when we get Covid hence freeing up hospital resources for other needy patients. To the 20 - 30% who are against the Vaccine for whatever reason or belief I support your decision but don't go around forcing it down people by posting information from obscure websites or quoting other Facebook postings.

Is anyone else feeling the same?

The only thing I feel they got right was their initial response to the pandemic - they didn’t throw us all under the bus as happened in other places, so thanks for that one thing Labour. 

The rest of their record is a litany of failures, half truths, and outright lies. 

This is just my early morning (probably uninformed) thoughts, I’m sure there are both more/alternative examples and arguments that can be made against these, but let’s not forget how LITTLE labour has really achieved and how POORLY they have performed; let’s not forget how CONSERVATIVE they really are in their policy choices, and how DETRIMENTAL this has been to average New Zealanders. 

Mental Health: remember early in their term when Jacinda was saying there was a mental health crisis and they were going to drastically improve our mental health services? Well nothing substantial was done here and now it’s dropped off the radar. Just anecdotal but you can’t get a therapist in Auckland as there’s only about 5 in any region, most are fully booked, and others charge $350 per session. I hate to think what it must be like for people with acute mental health issues. 

Housing: remember when Labour was going to build tens of thousands of affordable homes and implement policy to address housing speculation? In reality they built about 10 kiwi build homes, then fully capitulated to their wealthy buddies and refused to implement a meaningful capital gains tax. Remember how quick Jacinda got in front of the cameras to tell everyone “don’t worry, no CGT tax on my watch”? It was like she got and angry call from the Property Investors Federation and quickly changed the policy to satisfy their demands. 

Hospital services: for the entire pandemic the government has been telling us “everything is under control, we have capacity, we’re not hearing of any issues” etc etc. While at the same time nurses, doctors, and medical staff are shouting “there are issues, we’re scared, we’re understaffed, we’re underpaid, we’re stressed and burned out, we feel totally undervalued”. So is Labour unformed here? Or do they just not care? Imagine you’re a NZ nurse, your industry had been systematically defunded for decades and as a result you’re underpaid, overworked, and stressed. The pandemic hits and you’re needed more than ever, but instead of addressing the obvious issues Labour not only ignores you, they publicly claim the OPPOSITE of your experience. So you plan to strike, but Labour goes to court to stop you! Then as Covid spreads and staffing levels come under even greater strain, Labour changes to law so that you now need to return to work with Covid! You couldn’t make this up. These are the moves of a DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE party. 

Drug reform: remember when NZ could have reformed their cannabis laws as the rest of the world is doing but Jacinda refused to offer support and it failed by a margin? Now we’re going backward while the rest of the world moves forward. It gets worse though - cannabis is legal in NZ for those who can afford it through the medical system, there is literally a legal system for those with money and an illegal system for those without! More awesome work from Labour.  

The cost of living: Jacinda says “there isn’t a cost of living crisis”. Again, is Labour out of touch here or are they just cynical, uncaring, and happy to say anything for political expediency?

Sorry this got a bit long. I know there are lots more examples, put them in the comments. Let’s remember how TERRIBLE Labour has done, how CONSERVATIVE their policies are, and how DETRIMENTAL this has been for most people."

- Daily, clear communication from our prime minister and health officials who give us an update before answering multiple questions in a calm and concise manner;

- Our easy-to-understand COVID alert system;

- Our quick responses to community cases - we only just found one case yesterday and less than 24 hours later we have info on not only this original case, but their workmate, that workmate's flatmates, and contacts of those flatmates;

- A very easy-to-use COVID Tracer app;

- Supermarkets, pharmacies, and other essential services remaining open;

- The COVID-19 Wage Subsidy and related subsidies to help with those who need financial support;

- The emphasis on getting quick, accessible mental health support if needed, such as through the Mental Health Foundation, and Instagram accounts like allrightnz where there are daily wellbeing and mental health tips

We can choose to whinge and complain and use the overheated language of “farce” and “failure” and “crisis” as an outlet for whatever angers are gnawing away inside of us. Or, we can choose to build on the victories we have already won against the virus to tackle the work that remains to be done. To paraphrase David Foster Wallace, the reality of our relative success in handling this pandemic is hiding in plain sight all around us. It is so obvious that we risk not even seeing it anymore. 


http://werewolf.co.nz/2021/08/gordon-campbell-on-our-polarised-attitudes-to-the-covid-response/

as ever with Campbell its an interesting and insightful read but I think the point on how we chose to see through these evens personally is worth thinking about

Virtually none of us have any power to change what is or will happen with regards to our covid response, so the endless what ifs and should, could and would are out of our control - doomscrolling and all the things so many of us are engaged in aren't good for our mental health and well being... we can choose how we respond and that choice might have significant bearing on us and those around us

Given the additional stress and anxiety lockdowns and covid has brought to so many of our lives perhaps the best way through this is to try and keep in check our fears and moaning at even single so called ""failure"" and focus on the many positives in what's happening around us - we're more united than divided, we're in a good position to stamp out this delta outbreak... we can and should be organising ourselves and others to be vaccinated (if able) and we're as safe as we can be given the nature of this pandemic

As our lord Fred Dagg once said, we don't know how lucky we are

True, though don't see how it is relevant.
True, plenty of papers/evidence via google, showing that lockdowns have, in general, made no difference on overall mortality.
True, personal test kits were effectively banned in NZ back in April last year. https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/covid-19-point-care-test-kits. Leaflet isn't saying if this is a good idea or not but how do you find out if you have had covid via an antibody test officially? Where do you go to get that done? Has that been offered or advertised to people? It is very relevant who has had it, yet here we are over a year on and this isn't even on the governments radar.
4 At best unclear. I mean how exactly do you run a trial to establish that asymptomatic people are spreading it? A google search brings up evidence for and against. Saying they do is based on assumptions that well someone must be spreading it...
True
True, plenty of papers supporting this, that infection rates were unaffected in places where mask wearing was not mandated or encouraged against those that did. Wearing masks isn't about data or science, it is about a cautionary approach and language such 'it can' rather than 'it does'.  https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-public/covid-19-use-masks-and-face-coverings-community
True. On it's own. False positives, too many cycles etc etc etc
True. It is experimental. We are still in clinical trials. Sure the numbers of trial participants is over a billion and the data looks good. Safe and effective etc. The reality is pharma companies, got to determine their own trial protocols, endpoints and reporting. Carefully selected the initial trial participants, and then got to exclude result as they say fit. 95% effective? 3410 suspected covid-19 cases in trial participants. You are running one of the most important clinical trials in the history of clinical trials and you can't even determine definitively whether your trial participants caught what you are looking to protect against or not.
True. Crickets. Can't even discuss it as they are obviously irrelevant. It is all vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. Safe and effective. Carry on with your lifestyle choices, not taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing. Your government have got you covered. They might have failed at public health initiatives to reduce domestic violence, obesity, child poverty and mental health, but this is their chance to shine."

It's not like other countries don't have their housing problems to deal with too. Sure, their pay will be higher than NZ, and have more supply and what not, but their houses will probably be equally high too.

In terms of the mental health issues, yea I'm in a similar boat as you. I got an average job, and live on a rent property with my parents so we all can ""save up"" but that's savings for just living cost not for a house. I feel like having anxiety issues due to the lack of not knowing what to do with my life/future. I don't know if it's just me, but I seriously can't think my future without my parents in mind, so it's like trying to sort of the future for 2 households and not just me...

The Annual Data Explorer presents results from the 2020/21 New Zealand Health Survey, with comparisons to earlier surveys where possible. Results are available by gender, age group, ethnic group, neighbourhood deprivation and disability status. 

Data for the 2020/21 New Zealand Health Survey were collected between September 2020 and August 2021. For some periods in 2020 and 2021, the survey was suspended in parts of New Zealand that had known community outbreaks of COVID-19. As a result, the sample size for 2020/21 is smaller than usual and the 95% confidence intervals around some estimates are wider than usual.  

Overview of key findings

Most New Zealanders are in good health


In 2020/21, 88.0% of adults reported they were in 'good health', which is defined as good, very good or excellent health. This is an increase since 2019/20, when 87.0% of adults were in good health.
According to their parents, 97.6% of children were in good health in 2020/21. This high level of good health in children has been fairly stable since 2011/12.
The rate of good health was lower in disabled adults (58.9%) than in non-disabled adults (90.9%).


Psychological distress among adults has increased over time


Nearly one in 10 adults (9.6%) had experienced psychological distress in the four weeks prior to the 2020/21 survey, an increase from 7.5% in 2019/20.
Adults living in the most deprived areas had higher rates of psychological distress (15.2%) than those living in the least deprived areas (6.1%).
Psychological distress was more common in disabled adults (27.3%) than non-disabled adults (7.9%).


Smoking rates have decreased and e-cigarette use has increased


While smoking rates have been declining for many years, the decrease over the last year was larger than usual. From 2019/20 to 2020/21, current smoking declined from 13.7% to 10.9% and daily smoking declined from 11.9% to 9.4%.
Smoking rates have decreased for all ethnic groups but large differences remain. For example, daily smoking rates were as follows: M?ori (22.3%), Pacific (16.4%), European/Other (8.3%) and Asian (3.9%).
Adults living in the most deprived areas are six times as likely to be smokers as adults in the least deprived areas, after adjusting for differences in age, gender and ethnicity.
6.2% of adults were daily e-cigarette users in 2020/21, up from 3.5% in 2019/20 and 0.9% in 2015/16.
E-cigarette use was highest in young people aged 18–24 (15.3%) and M?ori (12.5%).


One in five adults have a hazardous drinking pattern


One in five adults (19.9%) had a hazardous drinking pattern[1] in 2020/21. This is equivalent to 824,000 people. The rate was similar in 2019/20 at 21.3%.
The age groups with the highest rates of hazardous drinking were 18–24 years (34.9%), followed by 25–34 years (23.9%) and 45–54 years (23.8%).
Asian adults (5.7%) had a lower rate of hazardous drinking than other ethnic groups: M?ori (33.2%), Pacific (26.5%) and European/Other (21.1%).
The rate of hazardous drinking has remained relatively stable for all population groups since the time series began in 2015/16.


[1] Hazardous drinkers are those who obtain an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8 or more, representing an established pattern of drinking that carries a high risk of future damage to physical or mental health.

Obesity has increased in both adults and children since 2019/20


About one in three adults (34.4%) were classified as obese[2] in 2020/21, up from 31.2% in 2019/20.
About one in eight children aged 2–14 years (12.7%) were classified as obese in 2020/21, up from 9.5% in 2019/20. Prior to this, the rate of obesity among children had been relatively stable.
This means that about 1.5 million New Zealanders were obese in 2020/21 (1.4 million adults and 100,000 children).
Children living in the most deprived areas were 2.5 times as likely to be obese as children living in the least deprived areas, after adjusting for differences in age, gender and ethnicity.


[2] Obese is defined as a person having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more (or equivalent for those younger than 18 years).

Some household food insecurity indicators improved in 2020/21

This is the first year the food insecurity indicators have been included in the Annual Data Explorer.


In 2020/21, about one in seven children (14.9%) lived in households where food runs out sometimes or often. This is down from 20.0% in 2019/20 and 24.1% in 2012/13.
In 2020/21, 13.7% of children lived in households where they sometimes or often eat less because of lack of money for food. This is down from 18.2% in 2019/20 and 22.0% in 2012/13.
In 2020/21, 12.2% of children lived in households that sometimes or often use foods banks. This is similar to previous years.
Children living in the most deprived areas were at least six times as likely to experience food insecurity as children living in the least deprived areas.


About one in 10 adults reported cost as a barrier to seeing a GP


About one in 10 adults (10.2%) reported not seeing a GP due to cost in the 12 months prior to the 2020/21 survey[3].
M?ori (15.7%) and Pacific (15.2%) adults were more likely to report cost as a barrier to seeing a GP than European/Other (9.7%) and Asian (8.7%) adults.
Among children, fewer than one in 100 (0.9%) did not see a GP due to cost in 2020/21.


[3] Comparisons with previous results have not been made because the primary health care questions were changed slightly in 2020/21 (to include video and phone consultations as well as in-person visits).

One in 100 children had an unfilled prescription due to cost


One in 100 (1.0%) children and one in thirty adults (3.1%) had an unfilled prescription due to cost in 2020/21.
Cost was more likely to be a barrier to collecting a prescription in disabled adults (7.5%) than non-disabled adults (2.7%).


Barriers to primary care due to COVID-19


This year some new questions were added asking respondents if they haven’t accessed primary healthcare because of COVID-19.
In 2020/21, 6.3% of adults and 3.6% of children did not see a GP due to COVID-19.
In 2020/21, 1.4% of adults and 0.4% of children had an unfilled prescription due to COVID-19.
Pacific adults and children were more likely to report COVID-19 as a barrier to seeing a GP and collecting a prescription than other ethnic groups.


Many more indicators are available in the Annual Data Explorer, including topics such as illicit drug use, nutrition, physical activity, sleep, sexual orientation, health conditions, health care use, patient experience, oral health and private insurance.

I have struggled with mental health issues for about half my life and I'm only 24. Over the years it's just been getting worse and worse. Last year it got to a breaking point and with some support from my one friend I went to the doctors at the start of November. I got a referral to the mental health team and got an appointment to see a psychiatrist at hilmorton on xmas eve. 

I got a diagnosis that made sense but I wasn't happy with it, I didn't want that diagnosis but it's what I've got. They made some reccomendations and I was told to follow up with doctor. 

It took them a month and a half to send the damn letter and then all my doctor could give me was 6 counseling sessions through CIC. I've already had counseling for years. I need more in depth therapy. 

I need ongoing talk therapy to help manage my mental health but I can't get what I need because I don't have hundreds of dollars to spend. Im only on a benefit. 

What's the point in trying to get help when I can't access it? I tried to help myself so much but I can't get what I need. Now I feel so put off, like I wasted my time. 

This isn't a covid thing either. Last time I tried to get a referral they told me I wasn't bad enough. Good thing I've always been too chicken shit to kill myself I guess. 

I don't know what to do really."

The lockdown has put a massive strain on our mental health system which is years behind most of our other health departments. We may not have streams of covid patients in the ICU but covid and the lockdowns have made a hard and essential job with shit pay even harder and it can only get worse. They need to be paid appropriately regardless.
You making this about other places only diminishes their hard work and the fact that they are long overdue pay rises"

Bonus points: have you ever seen the gorgeous sunsets/rises in Australia? 

Negative points: rego was $750/yr in Victoria."

So what you’ve got here is a tiered system of people who are working seeing people who aren’t working getting extra benefits.  I can understand that frustration.  But you also have people who aren’t getting benefits seeing those working and receiving some assistance, also getting some more help.

It creates a series of animosity towards the tier below you for getting more.

I’m well beyond getting any benefit money from the government and I support my taxes going to those that need it.  The problem is the media drives a wedge into beneficiaries being lazy and not wanting to work.

They don’t see my best friends mother who has had severe medical complications her entire life and can’t sustain a full time job, so requires government money to survive.

They don’t see my friend who lost his job during Covid and who’s trying so hard to get a new one but because he works in tourism is struggling to find anything real.

It doesn’t see my brother who has depression and works part time as much as his mental health will allow him to before he hits his wall and just throws it all in again.

No, all it sees is the overweight smoker who has 8 kids who sits on her couch all day smoking cigarettes while watching daytime TV and taking her money to the pub to gamble on the pokies. 

I support the safety net for the first three, and if we need to encompass the safety Net for #4 because the costs of differentiating them from the others is too difficult and costly?  So be it.

For those businesses who are complaining they got nothing, where do you think these extra billions are being spent?  It’s not on a lambo and it’s not bei be put into savings, it’ll go to your company, another blanket for winter, an extra loaf of bread, new shoes for the kids, a drs appointment or dental checkup that may not have been taken before.

This money is money that’ll be spent, it is money that will circulate.  If that means I’m not getting a tax cut at the top bracket, then he’ll yeah, if that kid can be fed, or that cancerous mole can be checked out, then go right ahead and spend on beneficiaries"

Things went downhill after lockdown though. Financial strain from having to take a pay cut, then job insecurity and eventually redundancy. Currently in a stressful work situation trying my best to make ends meet for a little longer. Had to drop most my hobbies due to finances, can’t see family for the same reason as they live out of town. Still see friends from time to time but can’t afford to go to the pub or go out for lunch as often as I used to. So spending a lot more time alone the last year. The stress is eating away at me, I’ve been to the doctor multiple times, called those helplines, it’s great to have a sympathetic ear once in a while but feels impossible to get any real tangible help. Life before Covid was the best it’s been for me. Now things are a real struggle."

Our suicide statistics are also abysmal. Yet, nobody is able to get appointments, either because of no slots/available times, the costs, or both. Wouldn't the solution be, then, to simply invest further in funding the mental health sector to make mental health services more accessible to all? 

But the thing is... mental health remains so stupidly underfunded in this country that, out of hundreds of well-qualified applicants for clinical psychology programs every year, only a dozen - if even that - are lucky enough to make it. Mental health professionals are booked for an entire year ahead or more, and can't even retire because there's just so much work needing to be done. No wonder nobody is able to get the help they need, when there is literally nobody available to do so. 

If I sound bitter, it's because I am. I'm a Masters student in Psychology graduating with an A - and not even my straight As, my highly qualified CV, and detailed letters of recommendation from psychology professors and people literally in the mental health field were able to even get me shortlisted for an interview. I got rejected and ghosted by every single clinical program I applied to. And the thing is, I can't even blame them, because I know that very limited number of spots every year comes from a place of little time and financial support from the country to do anything more about the situation. Doesn't mean it still doesn't suck, though.

So now, after nearly a decade of psychology studies and a mountain of student loan debt, I'm back to working in retail as my education overqualifies me for minimum-wage jobs, but is neither sufficient nor relevant enough to get me a """"career"""". A Masters isn't considered enough to get me even any therapy-related job, because I'm not ""qualified"" by just that alone. So now what?

I'm thinking of just giving up and going into a completely new field altogether where I could actually have a chance at getting a career. I don't mean to sound boring at parties but if you're considering getting into psychology for the passion like I did, maybe start looking into other career paths or safety nets to rely on in case it doesn't work out. Keep your expectations realistic, I suppose. I was passionate, but naive. I desperately want to help people, but the country doesn't want me to. 

Just wish the government would do more for mental health in the country by actually taking some action to accompany the empty words they say about it. There's only so much that preaching ""much aroha"" and ""reaching out"" can do."

I am really sorry to hear you are having a shit time of it. As a fellow IT person I know our industry can be extremely cutthroat, and to be perfectly honest, bigoted. For employment your age will undoubtedly be working against you - however, there is now a genuine shortage of skilled IT people (thanks COVID). Because you’re so burnt out by it I wouldn’t recommend jumping headlong into new employment anyhow. What I would suggest you do is join some professional networks (like ITPNZ or NZSA etc) and get talking to people. Social (and professional) isolation sucks, especially as you aren’t alone in this. If you’re in employment right now you may wish to consider some mental health time off which your GP can approve and WINZ will fund (not good money, obviously) and take that time to work on this without that added pressure. Volunteering is a great way to make new contacts (you can find opportunities via those professional networks), and could help you to get started on your own. Being a consultant or contractor is one area where age doesn’t work against you. Businesses don’t like young people telling them what’s what.

But most importantly keep seeing your doctor and make sure they are aware you are in this state. Life can be an absolute bitch sometimes. Sounds like you have put the weight of the world on your shoulders."

I’m usually only here for memes and funny videos. But the tone of this sub and reddit in general has changed a lot over the last few years. Honestly I’m quite scared of posting this as I’ve seen how many of you feel about people like “us”.

To preface this. Everyone in our home has had all their standard vaccinations as well as some additional ones due to living in and being from some “third world” countries. We have never had any issues with vaccinations, we took them as a matter of course, to be protected from nasty illnesses.

Our story starts here…

Yes, generally serious vaccine injuries are rare. And that’s all it is, until it happens to you or those closest to you.

As soon as my partner’s retired mother was invited to book an appointment for her first dose, she did. It happened to be booked the day before the country went into level 4 in August this year and that night she thought she was having a heart attack but didn’t want to be a burden. It was shortly after midnight, we were solidly in lockdown.

The next morning she booked a phone consultation with her GP, she told her what had happened the night before and said she thought it might be a side effect of the vaccine because it hadn’t happened before. She was immediately shut down, called stupid, gaslit, and a conspiracy theorist. Her GP said it wasn’t on the official side effects list so it wasn’t possible (how do you trust a medical professional who thinks so little of dismissing you when you’re genuinely afraid for your life). The call lasted all of 5-10 mins and was charged $60 for the pleasure of being belittled and insulted. The GP also refused to report what happened to MedSafe, which I would have thought is highly unethical. How are we as a society supposed to find out about legitimate issues and concerns, if nothing outside of the “officially listed side effects” can be reported - those being a sore arm, headache and tiredness for a few days, as Stuff keeps reminding us are the only side effects to speak of.

It was weeks before she even started to feel like she was betting back to normal. She had changed doctors (who also said what happened to her as a patient was unethical) and her new GP was convinced that her risks were low and could get a second dose. The GP prescribed going on blood thinning medication a couple of weeks before just in case she has another bad reaction. She goes and gets her second dose, goes home, and not long after, her heart rate shoots through the roof. She faints, hits her head and gets rushed to the A&E where she spent the next 6 hours on 4 different medications to get her heart rate down to prevent a stroke or heart attack. She had told the doctors that she had had her second vaccination dose earlier that day and then the Drs said it might be related. But as far as she is aware there was still no report to medsafe - although I guess both incidents would be in her medical file.

She still isn’t fully recovered. She had no follow-up, no check-in and no support even when she did her part and was abandoned by the government, the medical system, and society. As acknowledging what she went through seems too much of an inconvenience, not on brand or on message.  She now refuses to get a booster, understandably.

My younger sister also had some concerning side effects after her first dose and spent many hours over a few days in A&E without successful diagnoses. I don’t want to go into too much  to protect her privacy as she has a job and it could affect her career. I’m sure you’re all aware the vaccinated moral majority has no issues belittling, shaming, and other-ising those who are hesitant. Regardless of why, or what’s been going on in their lives, without even so much as a passing interest, just relishing in passing judgement.

When something like this happens to someone you care about… it completely shatters any trust you have in the medical system, the government, and fellow New Zealanders who have been so quick to judge and belittle without thought or care for human beings who might be suffering on the other end.

My partner and I have decided not to get vaccinated until a little more light is shed on these issues so that they can at least be acknowledged, somewhat understood and hopefully be treated by the people who pledged to support us when our health suffers - rather than being swept under the carpet and ignored like unwanted goods.

Obviously we personally know many people who have received the vaccine without major issues. But when this happened to my partner’s mother and we saw how she was treated by medical professionals here, it put us all on edge. (We’re all outsiders here as it is, being foreigners of colour, who have had a hard time getting doctors to pay proper attention to us even before covid) and then my sister. It’s a hit rate we can’t afford to be comfortable with. Yes we might be more likely to get covid but at least it will be acknowledged as something that exists and will be treated accordingly. We won’t just be ignored, belittled and gaslit. Our story is personal to us and I don’t think it should affect anyone else’s decision. But it has affected ours.

If people in this sub care as much about others, and the health of our society as they claim. And not just about being right and flexing their moral superiority, 
Please listen to the stories these people have to tell.  This is not about political affiliations. It is about health, society, and its effects on mental health. These are real people with real lives. They did what they were told was their duty to society and no one seems to care about their fears, their pain, their forever changed lives - except for a few doctors willing to risk their livelihoods and careers to help and represent them. I can’t think of anything braver. And none of the invited senior government medical representatives even bothered to show up to the hearing. 

https://youtu.be/lepqvdXoA2E

This is not a simple black and white issue as much as we would all like it to be, things would be so much simpler. Don’t be so quick to judge. Treating others with humility, dignity, respect and understanding goes a long way, and hopefully we can solve and get through this together.

You might not here about us, but that doesn't mean we don't exist, just that there's no place for us to be heard. Because we are a too much of an inconvenience.

In the meantime we’ll continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, socially distance ourselves, and avoid any large gatherings. Hopefully one day we can rejoin society without stigma.

Sorry if this comes across as ranty. This has been affecting our family for awhile now and we have nowhere to turn, no one to talk to and no one we can trust except each other. It hurts to see what everyday New Zealanders think of us and others who might be suffering in silence.

I most likely won’t be responding to comments as I’m too scared to check what the response will be."

I'm the only fully vaccinated in the house (partner booked his first jab as soon as a slot became available in mid September) so I take the risk. We only do it once a week and I head to the local dairy once mid-week when we're inevitably running low on milk and bread. We have three kids under 5.

This week's shop was a lot worse than any I've ever done. Huge queue way down the street, so it was a solid 60 minutes before getting inside the store. In the queue ahead of me was a young person and in front of her was a middle aged woman. For some reason (because truly this seems very bizarre to me) the middle aged woman just started loudly talking about lockdowns, and ""freedoms"", and how dangerous the vaccine is, how it's ""genome therapy"" (she really liked that term and said it a lot, kept telling people to ""look it up. It is called genome therapy, it changes your dna"") how it is experimental and no one should let themselves be a guinea pig, how people are dying from the vaccine, but that she's not antivaxx, in fact, she supports all other vaccines, just not this one (??). The young person directly behind her was like ""yeah, I know, seems dodgey aye?"" and while they were much quieter, they were nodding along in agreement.

I tried to stay quiet. I don't have social media, so I don't see these kinds of posts and bullshit. In order to maintain my mental health, I really need to not directly know about people like this. Eventually I got this awful feeling that everyone else around me in this queue (at least 100+ people and another 100+ in store) all thought like her and agreed with her. None of them were saying they didn't. Some were nodding. Is this normal?

I got so upset that I actually surprised myself and blurted out my story:

My first two babies were born premature and spent time in the NICU. My oldest, my boy, he caught RSV and was in the NICU intubated and heavily sedated and we almost lost him. It was the worst time in my entire life and I didn't think I would survive if he didn't (I started crying at this point, trying to talk about this because I still have flashbacks and grief still that I find overwhelming). He made it through, but with significant damage and scarring to his lungs. He's five now, and when he gets the inevitable winter cold, we invariably end up back in the pediatric ward on oxygen. We know that if he gets covid it would very likely be a death sentence. At the very least it would destroy what remains of his scarred lungs and respiratory system. Even typing this makes me feel sick. I am fully vaccinated because I would never, ever recover, I would never be able to live with myself if I caught covid and passed it on to him. He kisses and snuggles me every single day (he's a wee affectionate dude!) so there is no way that he wouldn't catch whatever I catch. He is why I got vaccinated. He is why fellow citizens in Aotearoa New Zealand need to get vaccinated. Because I believe his life is worth it. What's more, in order to function in this society I need to believe that my fellow kiwis believe his life is worth it too.

I think they were just shocked I told them, a bunch of strangers my personal story. The young person just kind of mumbled and looked away. The middle aged vaccine nonsense spouter just said ""well, you made that choice for you"" (I don't know what this means?)

I was so shaken that I don't know how I made it through the shop. I felt like people were staring (probably not) but I just felt like a raw wound. 

My honest question is how do people do this? Do you just ignore stuff like this? Is it important that people hear that this is not normal or humane to share dangerous lies about covid and vaccines in public? Or has everyone decided it's not worth it? Today I felt really alone."

I found him to be reasonable and passionate about his cause, and it is true that getting mental health assistance as a child is very difficult in this country; he's trying to make it more accessible. I also found him to be a nice guy, easy to talk to, and relatable.

I don't see it discussed often enough just how beneficial covid has been to the New Zealand news organisations. Especially at the beginning of the pandemic and at the start of every lockdown. Often if you have a cursory look at the stuff homepage it will be hard to find a single leading article that doesn't mention covid. TV news are doing a special segment for all the press conferences etc. All this means is that they have more clicks and more eyeballs on their content during a pandemic.

I just wanted to highlight this, news organisations here are dis-incentivised to tone down the fear and anxiety around covid. The articles practically write themselves. You basically take any subject and run a covid angle on it. But it sells better with fear, its a much easier subject to find a negative covid story after all. This is not to play down any of the risks of covid, or to say its not dangerous.

All of this is to say that if you are struggling with your mental health and feeling down, especially if your locked up. I see some posts on here where people are really full of doom and gloom. People are being pitted against each other, its not healthy. 

If you are having a hard time of it it, I implore you to just have a few days of not reading the local news. See if it helps you out a little bit, having this shit on your mind 24/7 for this long is not good. I have seen some posts here that make me feel sad, because I think people are stressing out about stuff that you don't need too. 

I will give an example, I have run into a couple of people lately that are really scared about their kids health. 

418 kids under 12 have died with Covid in the USA, that doesn't necessarily mean its from the covid. and in the UK its was 25 kids under 18 out of 18 million that passed away directly from covid (until Feb 2021). If you put it into NZ population it would be like 5-6 deaths. 

Which is not abnormal for meningitis deaths pre pandemic with a widely used vaccine. For this reason I think that unless your child has a pre existing condition then you should not be scared. And most importantly the kids shouldn't be scared. I guess I'm still a little traditional, my mum wouldn't discuss her struggling with finances etc with me. Because she didn't want me to worry, and I think that kids should be sheltered from having this pandemic dominating their childhood.  

Full disclosure I guess, I don't have kids so if you do do your probably well in your rights to tell me to shove it and I don't understand haha."

The emergency housing and benefits are good things for those marginalised especially due to covid. 

The PGF is keeping a shitload of people in employment. 

I agree the mental health funding has been an issue, it was awesome they allocated more money than ever for it, the problem is the DHBs are useless, which leads to another win with the government abolishing them.

Sounds like you just don’t like spending money, which is fine, but that doesn’t make these things failures."

I head into my shift in charge as an Emergency Medicine Specialist. I park and walk past the ambulance bay, noting all the ambulances parked, I speak with some tired but cheerful paramedics even though it has been 30 minutes since they arrived with their patient – the triage nurse hasn’t got to them yet.
I see my colleagues, busy caring for patients, contacting specialties, arranging tests, performing procedures, talking with families. I see police lining the corridor. I call for security when I hear someone screaming profanities at one of our nurses. I note that our isolation rooms are already full.
I see that we have one resuscitation room available, the rest are already full. There are three people mentally unwell who need care in a mental health unit, one of who is suicidal and has been in the busy and bright emergency department for over a day. 
There is no room available in any mental health unit in Auckland. We try our very best to provide them with care, but we are not a mental health inpatient unit. There are multiple patients waiting for admission to a ward; I am told that no beds will be available until the next morning. The charge nurse and I sigh. Another evening of balancing emergency care with providing ward care to those we’ve already seen and admitted with hardly any room in the emergency department. The nurses bear the brunt of this burden.
That was in early August, before the current outbreak.
Now, I head into my shift in charge as an Emergency Medicine Specialist. Before I’ve left I have to shave so the N95 mask seals. I ready a box for my clothes (when I get home I strip naked before
entering and beeline to the shower, I don’t want to infect my family).
The ambulance bay is packed. Everyone is in PPE, I can’t recognise people. The paramedics look tired. I don my N95 mask, check the seal and enter the department. Inside, all my colleagues are in full PPE. I see all the negative pressure isolation rooms are already full. The pregnant patients wait alongside the suicidal patients and the elderly breathless patients. I am told the hospital has run out of negative pressure rooms on the ward, but that one might be freed up in an hour. There is no plan in place for what to do if there are no negative pressure rooms available. 
The charge nurse and I make one up. It is not ideal and has some risk. We inform management of the situation, but they can’t magic up new wards. A call from microbiology, “another CoVID positive result”. I quickly confirm that the patient is in a negative pressure room rather than in our makeshift four bedded very unlikely but theoretically possible CoVID space. They are. A relief – I would feel responsible for causing extra infections.
I hear security being called. I walk behind them and see someone in a negative pressure room throwing medical equipment around the room. They are CoVID positive and are thought to be high
on methamphetamine. We can’t calm them down, the situation escalates. The security guards have to restrain them, risking CoVID infection.
A CoVID outbreak brings so many new incremental tasks and barriers to care and the new addition of significantly increased risk to the personal health and wellbeing of healthcare providers and patients. Paramedics, nurses, health care assistants, doctors, security and cleaners take an extra 3 minutes to don and doff PPE for every interaction. 
If I interact with 20 patients during an in-charge shift - that’s an hour of the shift that I am spending donning and doffing PPE that I could be using to provide care. Rooms need extra cleaning. Wards want to wait for negative CoVID swabs before admitting people even though they aren’t supposed to – I get it, they don’t want to be infected either. 
Our Emergency Department is more and more frequently overflowing. Ambulances might wait over 30 minutes to transfer their patients to our care leaving them unavailable for 111 dispatches. People can wait half a day for an ambulance transfer between hospitals – there are none available.
We hear a lot about ICU beds. It is absolutely true that we have half the number we should have even in the absence of a pandemic. But this issue is only one part of the problem.
If the number of unvaccinated CoVID cases increases significantly the problem will be that the entire health system will be overwhelmed - what will that look like?
How many ambulances, emergency department rooms, and ward rooms will there be, and, crucially, will there be enough healthcare workers? When wards and EDs are full, ambulances cannot hand over care of their acutely unwell patients and
so they wait in the ambulance bay for hours and days. When that happens, there will be no ambulances available. When an ambulance is called for my friend’s baby that is born early at home, for my uncle’s chest pain, for my cousin’s car crash, for my grandmother’s fall, my child’s nut allergy or my neighbour’s child with asthma - they may be queued at the hospital ambulance bay and unable to attend.
When wards are full, patients wait in the ED and when the ED is full, they wait in the waiting room and the corridors.
This is in Auckland, where there are more ambulances, more ED beds and more ward beds than Whanganui, or Taupo, or Greymouth.
Everyone has their reasons for or against the vaccine. These are my reasons for the vaccine:
Vaccination decreases the rate of infection and therefore decreases the number of people who become unwell with CoVID.
The Pfizer vaccine provides around 95% protection from symptomatic viral infection after two doses, which means 95 people out of 100 exposed to the virus will not develop symptomatic CoVID. Face coverings and social distancing help to further decrease the risk of infection on exposure. As there is active community transmission, we are all exposed. 
Those vaccinated individuals who do become infected have very mild symptoms and so are less likely to pass it on. Fully immunised individuals rarely become unwell enough to require hospital level care, so they rarely need to come to hospital. This then decreases the risk of infection for health care workers. Every infection in a health care worker has flow on effects, it is at least 10 patients per shift per clinician that have to be cared for by someone else in the place I work.
As the cases in the community grow, and contact tracing struggles to keep up, more cases become infectious in the community. The capacity to follow-up patients with Healthline also becomes exceeded while GPs are taking on more care for CoVID patients in the community. GP practices are already overloaded, and people with chronic disease may not be able to get timely care or may feel uncomfortable seeking care – becoming acutely unwell as a result, needing hospital care. 
Except when they need it there may be no bed for them, and, no ambulance.
That is a health system overwhelmed."

No unexpected drop-ins, less pressure to attend family stuff (Covid-19 helped there too), etc. But being in another country has been excellent. Add in that NZ is my ""happy place"", the fact I've been able to drop one of my anxiety medications speaks volumes as to what it's done for my mental health. 

As always, I wish I could see my extended family more, because they're awesome. They're all in Brisbane or Melbourne though, so that's a bit of a bummer being that far away from them."

at the moment you are doing, effectively nothing - nothing will change - and a bigger protest will probably also not change anything. 

There are much bigger things effecting more kiwis more seriously than farmers having to pay an extra few grand for a new ute, they will lose any public support pretty quickly on that one. (mental health, cost of living, cost of housing, lack of housing... COVID are all bigger and effecting more. )

so.... ramp up your protests now - because at the moment, you are just fucking off the very people who you will need the support of.

The country weighs cost (in both freedom and money) against death rates all the time - Mental health funding, road rules and safety, availability of medical treatment, even the ability to purchase alcohol/cigarettes, etc. Therefore it is confusing to me that any discussions around weighing up the negative impacts of  the elimination strategy vs. the expected life savings are met with such resistance with the rhetoric that one death from COVID is too many.

Sure the elimination strategy served New Zealand extremely well over the last 18 months and no doubt saved potentially thousands of lives. But as our vaccination rates get higher and we understand the treatment and health effects better, the cost of the strategy should at least be a point of discussion."

Go through the questionnaire:

Underlying health conditions


You can get early access to the COVID-19 vaccine if you're aged 16 years or over, and meet one or more of the following criteria:


You have a health condition that means you're eligible for a publicly-funded influenza vaccine, including pregnant people.
You have been diagnosed with severe mental illness (which includes schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder, and adults currently accessing secondary and tertiary mental health and addiction services).
You have poorly controlled or severe hypertension (hypertension is another name for high blood pressure). In this case, severe is defined as requiring 2 or more medications for control.
You are severely obese (defined as a BMI ?40)."

I was watching a story from the US last night that was quite home hitting in where their hospitals are getting quite overwhelmed but something like 95+% of covid patients are unvaccinated.

This is the shit that should be thrown in front of the anti vaxxers. Scare them into getting the jab with a dose of actual reality, not some pseduo science invented by people that should really be under the care of the mental health system."
