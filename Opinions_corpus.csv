Sophia, in her final year of study to become a primary school teacher, had been particularly afraid of COVID-19.
 

“I’ve been really scared of COVID, really scared.” On top of the fear of COVID-19 itself, Sophia didn’t want to be the first to test positive in her household. Feelings of guilt and shame were hard to shake.
 

But she soon realised she was in safe hands with her house of five flatmates. “Because I was the first one to test positive, I felt really bad, but everyone was nice to me and made me feel a lot better. They told me everything was gonna be fine.”

You’re alone in your room and don’t do much with your day, so talking to someone else about their day helps you feel like you’re living a day in a life of another person.” 
 

Keilan also warns against spending too much time on your phone and social media.
 

 “Be careful of your phone, stay off social media as much as you can. It can bring you more worry and a fear of missing out.” 
 

Looking back, Keilan feels his “ten days in isolation just flew by.” 
 

He thinks this comes to down to his perspective. 
 

“The feeling of being isolated is not easy but it felt a little easier for me because I was just happy to finally be in New Zealand. I’ve tried to come here for two years but I couldn’t due to the border restrictions. Sometimes I would just lay in my bed and enjoy the fact that I’m finally here, ready to start my studies.”","University student Keilan Rochette arrived in Auckland from his homeland Tahiti in February this year, moving straight into the seven-day MIQ quarantine.

Teah lights up when she talks about George, his ability to connect with others, and his passion for helping wh?nau and addressing inequities. 
 

But what makes George’s mahi particularly awesome is that he’s pretty new to the vaccination game – he’s what’s known as a lay vaccinator – trained to administer the COVID-19 vaccination in these special circumstances (under the supervision of healthcare professionals) with Waipareira Trust. 
 

George had only just started his job at Waipareira Trust as a workforce development project lead when the August 2021 lockdown hit, and the entire Trust workforce was redeployed to support the COVID-19 vaccination effort.

When you’re taken out of activities for a while, a lot of people struggle with not being able to do things they’d normally do every day. Uni or work or working out, anything. You just have to give yourself that time to recover. Don’t get angry at yourself for not being able to do something. It takes time.”
 

For this flat, help came from outside, too, “One thing we were really grateful for is family. We’d get care packages with meds and puzzles. It just feels nice that someone is thinking of you in a hard time.” Sophia says. ““I don’t have family in Auckland so I was grateful the other girls had family who could bring stuff. And I’d call my family, call my Nana. I know my family really appreciated it when I called them.” 
 

Sammy was the first in her family to have tested positive for COVID-19. Her family was very worried about her, but found talking to her about her symptoms and feelings helped them all.  “Sometimes if you keep it in, it bubbles up and seems like so much, but when you talk about it you realise ‘I’m actually okay’. So don’t shut yourself away.”
 

Looking back, Sammy and Sophia say it was little kindnesses and moments of joy that got them through it “It is hard. Being in isolation is hard. You just have to recognise it. Just remember how everyone else is feeling. Look out for each other. If you can tell someone is feeling sick, then talk to them, ask them about it, see if you can help.

Bridget says patience for yourself will get you through it.

You have to remember what each ball is made of, the family one is glass, and all the others like work, they are plastic. They’re important but they’re not the most important.”

The below quick tips can help you navigate some of COVID-19's uncertainties while prioritising your own wellbeing.
 
 Focus on what you can control 

Our brains don’t like uncertainty. Usually, we manage it by creating plans and anticipating the future with some confidence, but that’s hard to do right now. 
 

Try to focus on what you can control rather than worry about what’s out of your hands. If you’re a natural planner, it might help to consider different scenarios and think through what you could do if each were to happen. For example, if 25% or 50% of your staff all get sick at the same time, do you have a pool of agency staff you can call on to step in? Can your team create handover plans now to make things easier in the future? What support can you offer your team while they’re unwell? If your site manager needs to self-isolate for a week, do you have someone trained and ready to cover? What can you do if these things happen? Being prepared can help to take away some of the stress if these things were to happen.

 Go easy on yourself and your staff

Reset your expectations to what’s going on now, rather than where you thought you’d be at this time. COVID is unpredictable and the stress and anxiety it can create is exhausting. So, go easy on yourself and your staff. If you or your team don’t achieve as much as you hoped, or you need to take things slow, it doesn’t mean you’re failing – it just means you need to take some time to let everyone recover. Giving yourself or others a hard time about it will only create more stress!
 
 Keep the communication going

You’re feeling your way through this time just like everyone else, so don’t shy away from communication because you feel like you don’t have all the answers – no one expects you to! Try to keep up regular communication with your team, especially if you have people working from home – a Zoom morning tea can work a treat. Staff will appreciate open and honest chats and having the chance to share what’s going on for them.

I didn’t think much of it until I heard some people in our dormitory had COVID-19,” he says.
 

Knowing people in the dorm lived close to one another, Keilan, who is majoring in zoology, decided to take a COVID-19 test with a group of friends. Keilan’s test turned out positive – and as someone who had just arrived in Aotearoa it stirred up a lot of stress. 
 

“I had nothing,” Keilan explains.
 

“My passport had expired so I needed to get that renewed, I needed to get health insurance, I needed to open a bank account here and I needed to enrol with the Massey university GPS - but I couldn’t do any of those things.”
 

Keilan felt the timing for his ten-day isolation period couldn’t be worse.
 

“The semester had just started. I’m a really stressed person so it was difficult. I was worried I wouldn’t do well because I was starting uni sick. My throat was so sore that I had to stop talking. I had headaches, I wanted to throw up. It took about five days before I could speak. All I wanted to do was to sleep.”
 

Keilan’s process to isolate from others also wasn’t what he had expected. He was sent to another dorm, Weka Halls, and phoned by staff to follow specific instructions so he didn’t “get anyone else sick”. Luckily, his university had plans in place to care for him, such as bringing him food and washing his laundry. 
 

“It was so good not having to cook or wash anything, it just meant I could use more energy to get better.” 
 

Despite the struggle, Keilan found some relief knowing that the university’s staff was checking up on him by phone calls on the daily. It also reassured his family living overseas.
 

“Every day the staff call you and ask how you’re feeling and how your symptoms are going. When my mother and family knew the staff were checking in, they felt okay. In a lot of ways it’s thanks to Massey that my family has some peace of mind.”
 

With the university staff’s support, Keilan started to recover. Doing something small and achievable every day helped him feel more in control.
 

 “Every day I would write down what I could and couldn’t do while I was sick. So, one day I’d focus on doing some exercise and stretching, on getting my body moving and blood circulating. Another day, I’d call my family and my friends, so I was either having a call or sending messages every day.” 
 

As he recovered, he ticked things off his do-list that had been put on hold.

“I tried to get organised, but not put pressure on myself to do 100% of the things I had to do -just small bits of stuff every day.” 
 

Keilan says being kept informed about COVID-19 by others was good for his mental health. 
 

“I’d ask other friends who’ve recovered from COVID-19 how it was for them - how they felt during and after isolation, the path and pattern of their symptoms. It can bring you some peace of mind, as you feel like you know what’s in store.”","University student Keilan Rochette arrived in Auckland from his homeland Tahiti in February this year, moving straight into the seven-day MIQ quarantine.

I was such a busy mum, I was home-schooling, there wasn’t much room for me   – write , learn about mental health and  help other people. Long COVID has made space for that.” 
 

Larisa now blogs about mental health, and has started studying a Graduate Diploma in Psychology, hoping to become a mental health coach. She has also found great purpose in helping the Long COVID community. 
 

“I’m very active in the Long COVID support groups. I’m one of the admins on a Facebook page and I’m also now running the Long COVID Kids side of things.” 
 

Being a big part of these groups has given Larisa a greater understanding of Long COVID’s reach, learning things that most people wouldn’t know.  “There are people in the Facebook group who’ve had it for two years. In our group we’ve got people who can’t walk, or have crippling migraines, or heart issues as well as the fatigue. It’s very different for everybody.” 
 

“I can see that mental health is going to be a huge factor in dealing with Long COVID.  People have had their identities, jobs, recreation activities, and communities stripped away, with no end in sight.”
 

Larisa says there are ways you can support people living with Long COVID that go a long way. “Helping people with Long COVID can mean just staying in touch. Asking them how they are, see if there is something you can do for them, letting people know you are there to help if you can.” 
 

Understanding is also paramount. Larisa continues “Understanding that someone with Long COVID is pretty exhausted so they might not be able to really engage in conversation, or if you visit they might not be up for inviting you in. It can just be too tiring. But knowing that someone cares and is willing to connect is really important.” 
 

When it comes to supporting yourself and your family, Larisa says being honest with yourself and others is key. “It always helps to let it out.  When it’s tough  I talk to my husband, and I cry.  I also often write about it. The process of writing lets me think about it a bit more and see things differently.” 
 

At the end of the day, Larisa says it’s family and appreciation for the little things that gets her through. 
 

“You can make quite a nice little life. When I do get to do things, I appreciate it a lot more.You learn to appreciate the small details  of life. Our family relationships are really strong. Being in this together has been pretty special, we understand each other. And the kids’ empathy for others, understanding how precious and difficult life can be, it’s amazing to see.”","Larisa, a mental health coach in training, lives in the Gisborne countryside with her husband, two teenage daughters, and numerous animals."

The changes have hit Larisa too, with even daily tasks now feeling unattainable. “Managing it is hard because it’s so easy to over-do it. You start feeling a little better and so you do a little bit more and then you're back three steps, you just feel rubbish again.

The result came after a notification that cases had been confirmed at their seven-year-old’s school.
 

“Testing positive was really scary for our son,” says Bridget, who works as a senior project manager. “As a seven-year-old all he’s heard for the last two years is ‘the virus!’ ‘COVID!’, ‘we’re not allowed to leave the house cause of the virus killing people!’""

A friend of mine had it like a week before me and she was quite sick in bed” Sophia says. But, luckily, her symptoms were mild. 
 

Sammy, on the other hand, had a tougher time. “When I get sick I usually don’t get that sick. So, when I was having the body aches I was a bit worried. I was scared it could get worse from that point. I always thought it was more like a cold, like you get it and then you get over it. I wasn’t expecting the longer lasting symptoms, like fatigue.”
 

Despite their difficulties missing university and going through the motions of individual symptoms, the pair found the real mental health struggles came after their physical symptoms had eased. 
 

“Once I was feeling better, I just felt, like I’m just being lazy, I’m just sitting around,” remembers Sophia.

“It’s difficult because you’ve still got to have your household running, but at the same time everyone is out of commission. It made for very long days in dark bedrooms,” Hohepa says. 
 

Initially, the wh?nau hoped they could isolate the first two positive cases – their 21-year-old daughter and her partner – as they are lucky to live in a two-storey home. Unfortunately, on day three of isolation, Hohepa, his wife and their 12-year-old also tested positive. 
 

“It felt like everything we’d done, clean the house, deliver meals outside the back door downstairs, it still made its way to us.”
 

There was initially some tension in their whare over how COVID reached their wh?nau. 
 

“There was a real energy shift in the house given that our two oldest weren’t rule followers. They’re 21 and 22, they were out and about, mixing with lots of people… It probably wasn’t fair on them, but there was lots of robust discussion about them being nonchalant.”

It was soon after that the girls and I started getting sick again and the four of us just never recovered.”
 

In early 2021  the information on Long COVID was sparse and Larisa says this created a real sense of fear. “When the symptoms first came up, we were just really scared. My son was so sick for so long and we didn’t know what it was. Then when you look into chronic fatigue, it’s all pretty doom and gloom. This was a year ago, when there was really nothing out there.

Here are some tips from Rachel Nelson, an Aucklander who’s ‘been there done that’ and has some wonderful wisdom to share.
 

When Auckland locked down in August 2021, Rachel and her wh?nau closed their bubble tight. As the mother of two boys with compromised health conditions, Rachel knew if COVID-19 made its way into her whare, it would have a devastating impact. Rachel and her husband did everything they could to stay safe at home for the entirety of the long lockdown.
 

“COVID is frightening,” Rachel says, “but my belief is if we work together, if our voices are heard, we know what we need to do to look after our people.”
 

Rachel knows some of the sacrifices we all need to make to keep our wh?nau safe from COVID-19 are a real challenge. “But, if we really love our wh?nau, if we really love our kaumatua, our kuia, our tamariki and our mokopuna, we have to do whatever it takes to protect them.”",Tips for supporting wh?nau who are isolating at home

Day by day I was hearing about different friends that were isolating, kids from school and their parents.” 
 

Bridget is aware that reaching out can be difficult. “I’m not very good at accepting help. I really had to take people up on their offers.” 
 

This was a big change from how Bridget likes to operate.  “Normally I’d just try and be polite. I’m just so used to us sorting things out on our own. 
 

“But we had so many people offer their support. It was important for us to take that step and say ‘yes, we do need help. We need lots of snacks.’”","The first COVID-19 positive test in Bridget Madar’s whare wasn’t a surprise, but it wasn’t welcome, either."

Apanui and Ng?ti Porou) are a strong team, working together to help their three boys through the uncertainties of COVID-19.

They were helping out around the house, getting the washing done and cooking dinner. They’d go into the little girl’s room and spend time with her, make sure she was okay.”
 

COVID affected everyone in the wh?nau differently.
 

“It struck me the worst out of all of us. I was off work for a total of eight days. It started off as a bad flu, fever, runny nose, sore throat, aching bones, and then about the fifth day I started getting pains in my chest and down the left side of my arm and body. When I sneezed or coughed it squeezed my heart. I said to my wife ‘if it’s still like this tomorrow I’m gonna take myself to the hospital.’” 
 

Luckily, it didn’t come to that, but it was an incredibly tough time. 
 

Hohepa says it was little things that helped get them through. 
 

“We’re lucky that we get meals delivered each week, which is a real simple way to feed the whole family and not overspend on groceries.” 
 

Help came from friends and loved ones, too. “We had neighbours drop off fruit and chocolates. There was lots of support from my colleagues, them saying ‘Just checking in’ ‘You need to rest and recover and make sure you’re 100%’ Having colleagues like that was really cool.” 
 

When it came to looking after his mental health, Hohepa says it all came down to keeping a positive mindset. He is the principal advisor – M?ori at the Mental Health and Addictions Directorate at the Ministry of Health, and he used this time to take on board what he’s learned at mahi and through his own lived experience of depression. 
 

“I was just trying to be as positive as I can for myself and the others in my household.” 

And, when keeping a positive mindset proved difficult, help came from an unexpected place.
 

“Our youngest, she was very caring for all of us. ‘Do you need a hot water bottle, a lemon drink, an iceblock?’ She took the lead and that was awesome to see. It meant a lot.” 
 

For others isolating, Hohepa’s advice is simple: “When you can, and have the energy, be connected.” Hohepa found he had the time for a long over-due call with his mum. “I hadn’t spoken to her in a while but I reached out and let her know what was happening. It felt good to talk to someone who you know loves you.”
 

 Hohepa says they initially didn’t tell anyone they had COVID, admitting they initially felt shame about being infected with the virus. . “I think it comes from a place of being whakam?.” But, Hohepa says it’s important to nip those feelings in the bud. “Know that people care about you. We had so many people reach out to us, asking if they can do anything for us. You don’t have to go through it by yourself.”

This lockdown lasted three and a half months. Don't want to go into it but basically anxiety and depression has gone up since then. It has been 4 months of no contact from my ex and my ex-flatties but I still self harm or have urges to self harm on a fairly regular basis (weekly - this includes slapping and punching my face, sometimes punching my desk), I went to cognitive behaviour therapy for it briefly with a therapist I had worked with previously. It just seems too easy to forget my coping mechanisms, I get dark on myself in my thoughts and can't stop looking on my phone but at the same time feel a little detached and disinterested. I just feel super nihilistic about things at the moment, I hate my job and it's harder to get out with all this COVID shit still going on.

Another thing I should note is I am also four months cold turkey from a big marijuana addiction, and still struggle a bit with impulses to drink heavily and do drugs when socializing. I feel I have been numbing for a while and now the bandage is off, after lockdown I have become far more internal as a person and I don't know what to fucking do.

My entire adult life I've suffered from my mental health struggles after years of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of people I cared about. I tried to take my own life a few years ago after my best friend died and I've worked so hard to rebuild myself since. 

My partner left me after I fell into a depression when covid lockdowns forced me out of work. She immediately slept with somebody else days later, not without trying to emotionally manipulate me and lie about it first. All of my previous struggles have came back tenfold and I feel completely helpless.

Now, out of nowhere, as soon as I'm finally back to a regular working schedule, fighting to carry on and about to leave for work, the police arrive at my door and I'm being served for things like multiple ""failing to show a ticket/concession"" from 8-10 years ago. Fines I did nit have the capacity to even pay or defend myself against at the time when I was so unwell I couldn't even work. I had no idea these fines were outstanding and I literally cannot pay them now after so long in lockdown, not to the sum they're demanding from me.

i havent been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness, but ive always felt an overwhelming anxiety and depression for years, especially during the heavier lockdowns. i never feel sad, but more unmotivated or an emptiness, and because of that, i never feel as though im allowed to tell people how i feel because im not like physically proving my feelings. during the first lockdown here in aus, i was having suicidal thoughts, but never told anyone because i had no reason for it, and didnt want to waste their time. Recently,  ive been having similar thoughts, but not in the sense of offing myself, but more in the hope that i wont live much longer. i think because of this i havent really taken care of myself, and i know i need to fix that in a sense, and understand the process of doing so, but i almost feel 'paralyed', then i spiral and blame myself for not doing better. like if my room is messy, a pig sty if   
 you will, and i'll say to myself 'i need to clean this, change my sheets, put away that dish with a plum pip covered in blue mold, or that shrivelled apple core', and yet, i dont move, like i cant move. i get this strangly with peeing at night aswell, basically i pee at night like normal, but then i constantly go back and sit on the toilet, at this point not peeing because its all gone, multiple times getting up and down  whenever i cant sleep. ive beenn doing this for months, i dont know what it is, and its kinda annoying. maybe im procrastinating sleeping, and this is just my bodys coping mechanism, idk.

i also get really bad intrusive thoughts, and they make me feel guilty for thinking such horrible things. and i know theyre not real, but i feel as though i cant even bring them up with people cause what if they think different of me? or that im whining? 

but i think my memory annoys me the most, i cant remember anything, and i constantly forget what im saying halfway through my sentence, in the middle of searching something up, just leaving things, or being in the middle of something, walking away, and never returing. but i think the thing i hate the most is the way its used against me in arguments, blaming my 'bad memory' to invalidate my feelings or perspective. i dont know if that directly correlated with with a mental illness, who knows.

this is probably a trauma dump, sorry. i think i just want some other points of view and advice from people who have gone/going through something similar. (long post, like almost an autobiography haha)

its alright if you don't care most of this is probably unrelated but my bpd has effected me for so long and even writing this is a help for me. maybe i could help somebody else by doing this

**Because of my recent mental health journey I've become more self aware of how my childhood has effected me, it will be in bold. these are mainly just theory's from both professional's and i. if you notice any. please let me know :)**

the main issue i am currently facing is my sense of self.

**fuck i hope nobody from school finds this, if you do, please, please dont tell other people .**

So ill start this by saying thanks for bothering to read this. hopefully this whole post wont be grim, it should cheer up towards the end :) This is partly a vent and partly a cry for help and looking for advice in general. i think for you to truly get the picture i might have trauma dump a lot. in fact ill probably dump a large part of my life on here. So skip past if your not interested, maybe this is the wrong subreddit. but my current goal is self improvement. (let me know if there's a better place to post this) 

currently im 17. i turn 18 at the end of the month (really dont want to, spent the last couple birthdays alone and miserable. i dont want to do anything for my birthday. nothing interests me). i have diagnosed anxiety and not officially diagnosed bpd (the doctors told me i have it but didnt want to officially diagnose because of the possible effect it could have on my mental health. im reasonably on top of the symptoms now. but i just have no idea what to do with my life.

ill start with my parents. my mother as a child moved around a lot. her father was in Vietnam and it fucked him up a bit. he killed himself. he worked in Papua new guinea as a representative of Australia way back when.  her mother owned a range of different motels over the years, this is why she was always on the move. by 17 she had lived on three different country's. she probably has mental health issues but i dont think shes sure, shes probably only started thinking about it recently because of my mental health journey. im not sure if i should ask, its not really my place. we dont have that sort of relationship. she was never good at making friends. like me. she moved back to Australia from NZ when she was 17 by herself.

**mental health issues were in my genetics. my father had extreme anxiety and i suspect a personality disorder. (like myself). My brother which i talk about further on has depression and was hyperactive as a child. maybe even now. (adhd?? not particularly familiar)**

My father was what happens when a severely mentally ill person self medicates with alcohol. i dont know much about his past. mum never talks about him. he wasn't a good man. he nearly killed me and my older brother multiple times by accident when we were children because of his alcoholism (nearly crushing infant me while unconscious). i believe my mum has implied he had a lot of childhood trauma.

My parents divorced when i was three, my brother was five. after that my dad went downhill fast. he would drink 3-8 cases of beer a week at least. (keep in mind he was a truck driver). we would see him every other weekend. My mum has told me about how terrified she constantly was whenever he picked us up. he was always drunk. She recently told me the story of how there was a big news story of a man who threw his 2 sons of a bridge to their death. My father thought this was very funny. he would often joke about doing it to us while we were sitting in the car (he was standing just outside talking to my mum.) my mother suspected he did meth as well. which certainly isnt uncommon for truck drivers here in aus. My mum said that he never abused her but im not sure if i believe her. she said she divorced him the day he threatened to kill her.

He remarried when i was about 5. i dont remember that much about her. mum hated her. as kids we thought she was gross, she had only half her teeth, the other half where completely black. she stunk like cigarettes and alcohol. she would try and hug us goodbye but we would never let her. She would pick us up when dad was too drunk to drive. (imagine just how drunk he was for HIM to pull over) i dont think he ever drove sober. the road he would drive us on to his house was a windy dirt road, on the side of a very large hill. he would drive this very old four-wheel drive very erratically. my older brother got really motion sick and i would try my best to not look out the window. i was scared.

my father died in febuary 2009. he drank so much he suffered a stroke. it was my mothers happiest day of her life (she told me recently). Its hard for me to say this but it was for the best. i would probably be dead if my dad was still alive. my teacher showed up to the funeral, which was very nice of her. My mum never talked bad about my dad growing up, she thought it was wrong. the main issue was that there was almost no good to talk either. he was almost never mentioned most of my childhood.

**This is probably when my Borderline Personality Disorder started to develop. i believe i was a little bit narcissistic when i was 5/6/7.** **this is a typical response from a child with a pd. This is also when i started maladaptive daydreaming. i would have spent most of my youth doing this, like a lot.. probably around 80% of my day when i wasnt at school. 4+hours at a time. i still do it to get me to sleep. most of the time it revolves around me being less lonely. getting into a relationship. happiness.**

My brother turned into my male role model. i wanted to be like him.

 however when i was 7/8 my older brother started bullying me. it was pretty constant. he wasnt the type of bully to beat me up physically. he is extremely smart. a near perfect memory. when he graduated he was in the top 5% of students in the state. he did this without doing any homework or trying particularly hard. he new he could get into the engineering course he wanted, at any university he wanted. when it comes to bullying, he new exactly what buttons to press, when to press them, how to mostly get away with it. he loved it. This crushed me. my self esteem was low. i wanted to kill him. like really do it. but at that age (8) i new that that was going to worsen my life overall. so i turned to killing myself. i was suicidal at 8, 8! what the fuck happens to a child to cause him to be that fucked up. i begged my mother to stop him, just force him to go away. i used to be on my hands and knees tears running down my face saying 'just threaten to take his DS away' (remember those? thats a childhood memory for ya). she did a few times at the start. My would just behave for a few days and get it back. then the bullying would start again. after a while she just got sick of it. got sick of my begging. 'just ignore him', 'walk into the other room'. im a 8 yr old with an undiagnosed emotional instability issue, with an older brother who will just follow me into another room. i couldn't. 

**for a long time i felt phony. like my trauma didnt count because i wasnt being beaten or assault   in heinous ways. to be honest im probably self conscious of my trauma because i feel i got off easy, but im still fucked up.**

**my psychologist finds this period of my life interesting. the blend of looking up to him and him bullying me. He mentioned that it could have left me with an interesting and hard to describe mindset. Filling a role, like an actor. In theory my brother made me feel like it was my place, my role. like i am always searching for a role to fill. not necessarily one like this role (of being the bully's victim). also other roles. e.g. like playing a video game and being assigned an assault class, (or Overwatch is a great example if anyone has played that) does anybody else experience this. it effects my day dreams too. what is this called??**

after he got bored it kind of just stopped. the strategy of sending him to the other end of the house came into effect because he wanted it to. to this day we still dont really talk. ive lived with him for months at a time without saying a word. he recently moved out and comes and visits occasionally to see mum. we dont talk. i dont want to talk to him.

**because of this after the period of bullying i was extremely isolated. i didnt trust my mother, because she didnt help me. and didnt like my brother. Interestingly the effect my mother/brothers actions had left me with a distrust/hatred of authority. (not a great trait to have). i also believe that it could have been my mother along with these other factors that have heavily effected my ability to talk to girls. im high functioning bpd, so i can still cope with the day to day chats. but texting a girl is something i could not dream of doing. ive tried and im extremely boring (sense of self) and often say the wrong things :/ maybe i just need practice.**

**the feeling of being 'alone in your own home' translated to the outside world.**

**i was so socially isolated that i believe ive developed a chronic feeling of loneliness. im socially awkward. bad at making friends. but hate being alone. i also dont have a great sense of family**

*bear with me here, eventually the story will get a little brighter.* 

growing up we were never an active family. never out in the community (live in a small town of about 5000, 300 kids at my high school across 6 yr levels.) we never really went out and did stuff. mum was tired and we didnt have that much money. we were far from poor but thats probably because we didnt do stuff. we always had to budget you know. we never really went on holidays like the other kids. i joined scouts as a kid (little to no girls).

This is the part where i had a mostly normal childhood (8.5-12). i was still maladaptive daydreaming way too much. and i was becoming jealous of my friends having dads . Mum did a decent job at being both parents . i had friends, school. still isolating myself at home though. (give or take 11) I mentioned once before that i used to be suicidal. my family laughed at me, 'impossible' they said. i also referenced throughout the years my brothers bullying. my family laughed, they thought this too was ridiculous. 

when it came time to move to high school (start of seventh grade (12-13), Australians don't typically have middle schools). i desperately wanted to go to a different school than the one my mum wanted to send me too. my brother got a choice of schools much further away, why didn't i? mum sent me to the one i didnt want to go to.

This was the point my relationship with my mother went downhill. i hated her for this. we started to get into fights about everything. i quickly realized how different we were. like if she likes something, i will genuinely, prefer the exact opposite of that. This was not to spite my mother. i just genuinely did. we grew further apart.

later on i never said hi to her when she came home after work. just 'whats for dinner' and if the answer was a conversation i hated it. i hated the sound of her voice, her choice of words everything. but i faked the relationship for my own benefit. i cringed whenever she hugged or kissed me. it disgusted me. our relationship from her end was better than it had been, we certainly had our ups and downs (i couldnt keep the act up forever).

**i feel guilty for the shit i put her through, however she doesn't remember any of the shit i went through. she genuinely doesn't remember it as bullying she thought it only happened a few times. she doesn't remember laughing at me when i told her i was suicidal. she remembers me telling her. i remember it clear as day. i know this was not exacerbated in my head or by my bpd. ive extensively considered that option.** 

My mother has a bad memory. probably from smoking so much weed in her youth (apple didn't drop too far from the tree)

**looking back at it now i probably had minor-depression for a large part of my childhood. I thought i was mentally healthy up till 16.5.**

i quit scouts when i was about 14, tried refereeing football for a bit because i got paid. stopped when i was 16.

the school i attend is small. the town is too. some kids in my grade ive known since i was 3 who im about to graduate with. because of this my friend group has pretty much stayed the same. i haven't been exposed to many situations where ive had to make friends. the only hobbies i had growing up were video games. and nowadays i dont like them because of the position they've currently put me in. i never talked to anyone after school but there was a period 14-16 where i played ps4 with friends. back when i didnt have a worry in the world. i was so ignorant to not see what my lifestyle was setting me up for. fukc me. the town being so small also makes it difficult to find work. any other friends. relationships (probably to anxious to anyways). there's not many clubs. or groups. nothing im interested in. this town + social isolation has fucked me.

**the impact me growing up in this town can not be understated. i believe it is almost cruel to make a child grow up in a small town. i used to solely blame this for my lack of identity. but it a combination of both the bpd and the town. it is also very closed minded. i didnt realize how closed minded till i left for a few months. the kids here will make fun of each other for doing just about anything they enjoy. especially for trying hard at something. tall poppy syndrome??**

and at 16 i realized i didnt like living here, i set up a student exchange to the USA. it was a stressful couple of months prior. i had started taking Accutane and effected my mood negatively. setting up and exchange in a rush (i applied late because of my anxiety- at the time i didn't even recognize it as anxiety). she saw an opportunity to get rid of me for twelve months and she really wanted it.

i worked out, in January of 2020 i moved to usa to start my exchange year. i was so happy. 

**the filling a role mindset had found a place to thrive. the role of an Australian in America is an easy one. people just like you for being Australian. i didn't need a deeper personality. it was easy to make friends. obviously this was not sustainable in the long term >12 months.** 

**i think without somebody else i am boring. im dependent on them for my personality. not myself. inside im hollow.**

in America i experienced my first sense of family. not with the family i was living with. but with the other exchange student i was staying with. life was good. I STOPPED DAYDREAMING ALL TOGETHER. maybe it was because i constantly had company that i liked, maybe because i was just happy and didnt need it for happiness any more

**the family i was living with were strict and that doesn't work well with a distrust/hatred of authority.**

I think you can predict what happened next. Covid fucked up the exchange. all the money we spent on the exchange was lost. and i got sent back into the one place id finally for once gotten out of.

i never really noticed while i was there but my friends at home literally never talked to me. even if we had a group chat to send memes through not even one. ''how is it?''. i was happier. naturally more talkative. there was a couple of times i tried talking to them but they just killed the conversation pretty quick. 

i found out too late that these 'friends' were mostly just company. 

i got back to Australia and entered a deep depressive episode. i almost grabbed the wheel during the drive home and sent us into a tree. i spent the next couple of months stuck inside at home. i avoided self harm at first but did it here and there. 

**i knew i would feel differently after i did it, i would be filled with regret and a sudden urge to live. unintentionally i was playing on my reactive mood swings.**

This was the around the time i realized how fucked up i am. my past really caught up with me. when school came back to in-person my 'friends' found a new interest. joking about how depressed i looked. less then half asked if i was ok. and in the end all but two they didn't really care. to this day i don't think they do.

*ok it takes a pretty fucking long time before it gets better haha*

**my bpd really started effecting my thoughts. this is clearly a point in my life that was heavily filtered through the lens of bpd. the fear of abandonment was real. not just a fear, a reality. it stopped me from seeing the two did care. i took these negative feelings out on everything. mainly myself.** 

**self love is important and its taken up till literally a week ago to actually understand that.**

 ***i had to surpass my own ego and realize what's truly best for me. happiness. unconditional happiness. not just happiness while in the us, or for that matter anywhere thats not here. no conditions . no limitations. 'tap into the unlimited power within'.***

**i am by no means happy but this is the key. certainly easier said than done. this section\^ is also what's called a higher state of consciousness. looking at the big picture. bpd brings you down to a lower level through emotional instability, and for me black-and-white thinking. (all or nothing)**

im quite good at hiding my struggles to the outside world. reddit, my psych, and my councilor are the only ones that know the truth. high functioning. after about 5-6 months of visible depression i just went back to hiding it. over the course of the 8 months after coming home i would have dozens of self harm incidents. 3 attempts and would have pushed a knife against my wrist countless times. i thought about killing myself every day. i also cried every day for about 5 months, then again for another 3. this time of my life was tough. i never told the other foreign student i lived with about this. not in depth anyways. i didn't want to bother them.

at the end of 2020 after trying to find a way to move out for almost a year, i finally got the chance. however my mum could not decide whether she wanted me too or not. by this time. i just didnt talk to her at all. i was going to move to Newcastle, NSW. but finding a place to live when your'e 17 is difficult. i applied hundreds of times to different houses on Flatmates but only got a few replies. all saying no :/.   
 and between that and not being able to apply to real estate places because of my mothers flip-flopping i didnt find a house. i gave up after i had missed 5 weeks of the school year and searching 5+ hours a day. 

this is the moment where i gave up on my academics. there was no possible way i was going to be able to pass the school year to a high enough standard to be worth it and i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life anyways. i decided in order for me to get through the year i needed a hell of a lot more professional support and a shit load of weed.

**having no sense of self had effected me for many years prior to this. the weed an iteresting effect initially. i believe it raised my conciousness and made me much more self aware.** 

*i am not here to glorify drugs. in the long run the eventually started making me depressed because i was smoking 3+ times a day .*

i initially smoked 3 times a week. the weed effected me so much and i was so much happier. mainly on the days when i didn't smoke but it was still in my system. i loved it. i also started taking antidepressants around this time. they fucked me up bad. my stomach was heavily effected by them and i was vomiting around 30+ times a day. So i started smoking more. The more i smoked the less i vomited. soon i was smoking 5 days a week. 

To this day my stomach is broken. i cant drink anymore. i throw up after like 3 beers. its tough. i also get really sick when im anxious. and my stomach hurts. i dont eat enough still.

after two months of antidepressants i went to a psychiatrist and the told me i probably had BPD. this wasn't an official diagnoses because they were worried about how it being official would hurt my mental health. but he said 'if this feels like you, you probably have it'. 

I easily fit into 7/9 of the criteria. and the other two i did not probably because im incapable of getting myself into a relationship.

**can someone give me some advice here. im so scared im going to become an incel. i know im capable of feelings, just not here.** 

being told about bpd was such a sense of clarity. i like to describe it as only having half the puzzle pieces and just finding out where the other half went. putting them back into place is a different story though. i was placed on mood stabilizers. they gave me a sense of clarity. it was strange because they made me much more aware of my actions. my mood swings, black and white thinking. 

**i went back to he car and when i got in i told my mum abot the bpd. she said she thought that was the case. she never told me. that pissed me off. when i told her it stems from my childhood and trauma she scoffed at me 'what childhood trauma?'**

over the next 6 months i would learn to understand myself more. get along with the 'company' more often. there was no benefit to me in hating them. 

recently i started getting along with mum better. i dont enjoy conversations with her. we dont fight anymore though. Thats probably more due to the growing on her side than mine. 

i started to interact with the world. i noticed when i would comment on tik toks i would feel better. and when someone replied back it made me feel good in some way.

 the current problem im facing is that im graduating soon and have no idea what i want to do with my life. Ive dreamed about getting out of here for a long time. this is  bad environment for my mental health. however there is two sides to this coin, leaving and going. i want to leave but dont know where i want to go. or why 

**just recently i realized that this going side is more about making friends than seeing the world. how can one move away with the sole intention of making friends (keep in mind im bad at it). Are friends not a by product of life? not a by product of moving?** 

ive been thinking a lot about going to college in America or Canada. me not having a sense of self means i dont know what i want to study. im not stupid enough to spend that much money on purely trying to make friends. what is my next move? do i travel through Europe and see some old friends from my first exchange? will they still like me? is that going to help me find me?  please help 

do i have more of an identity than i think? is my limited social interaction stopping me from seeing that?

also im looking for ways to develop socially

thanks for reading this far. sorry for any mistakes.

im also trying to figure out the things i like in life. i like music, especially lil peep. his music really helped me when i was about to kill myself so many times. cant really listen to some of it as it makes me depressed but some of it makes me happy. (could be because i used it as a mood stabilizer during my depressive episode.) news and politics. travel. i guess thats about it.

i considered a degree in journalism but im bad at English and the pay is really shit and only expected to go down.",

I have OCD and severe depression. I ended up in a mental health facility in New Zealand a few days before Christmas. I called our crisis help line at 8pm when my parents took me to the ER, they arrived just after 1am. I was suicidal and going to do it. They gave me two quetiapine and sent me home. I made it to the parking lot before melting down so my dad took me back in.

I was voluntarily committed. Due to covid they wouldn't let my dad come with but they assured him it was fine. He reminded them that I have OCD and asked that they make sure it is clean and they said that it was all good. They were out of beds in all other areas so I was put in the observation room of the ward for people who had been committed by the courts. It was filthy. There was a bag of rubbish in the bathroom with dirty wet wipes, dirty coffee cups in the water dispenser and food and dirt all over the floors. The NZ health systems policy under covid is that every room needs to be sanitised between patients. This wasn't even cleaned. Don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting much. I knew our wards were old and run down but this well worse than my very low standards.

What really gets me is that when I asked them if they could clean it they said that ""under the mental health act it doesn't have to be clean"". They have a no photo policy, I took photos. I called my parents and they came and got me. I went in rational but suicidal and left on the verge of a panic attack.

I was told that when a room became available in another ward I would be contacted. They called my dad twice the next day while I was asleep not with a bed but for a check up and I have since not heard from them. My parents aren't mental health experts and had basically been on suicide watch for coming up 3 days with no sleep. I just wanted help but there is none.

A few days after getting home I got a note that my psychiatrist appointment had been pushed from the 20th of Jan to the 16th of Feb. My nurse saw me a couple of days after I was in then went on holiday. I saw her again on the 7th of Jan. Shes on holiday at the moment due back mid Feb. I get one appointment every two weeks with her. Sometimes I go more than a month with no contact. I get people have lives, but if your nurse goes on holiday even for extended periods you don't get a ""backup"" nurse to come see you.

I see an outside therapist once a fortnight through a charity who are not equipped to deal with severe mental health issues. I thought I was on the waiting list to see someone through the public system but I've waited over 6 months to no avail.

My optimistic opinion is that they don't care if you live or die. I won't share my pessimistic opinion. Don't get me wrong I've seen good people before. But the system is broken and not only have they not fixed it the government reforms have made it worse.

This isn't even the half of it.",

So during my first break I went to my friends and for a bit we were just talking about stuff, and then all of a sudden they started making fun of me for always being so *close* to them, being *right up against them*, having my shoes *touch* theirs, not leaning up against the wall like them and instead standing in the open by doing things like standing in a circle against each other (during covid). Then the bell rang.

After the bell rang once more for lunch I went back and my friends decided to play a game (we play it because for some reason people still like playing it), so one of my friends said I should be in, then someone mentioned someone else not being in ""for ever"", that person then complains about it and says it should be me, I and another say we both could be since we are both pretty bad, then they decide on counting to 21. It of course lands on me being in, then one of them tells me to count for 90 seconds which I complain about because nobody else counts for 90 seconds, however it's just dismissed. Afterwards I count for a minute because that is the usual, so I start to chase after them then when I catch up, one of them complains about me not counting for a minute, the other says I was supposed to count for 90 seconds, consequently I decide to do something better with my time.

After all of that I notice they keep coming to the area around my classroom but I'm not sure if it's they want to apologize, poke more fun at more, or anything else? As a result I ran from the area until the bell rang for the penultimate time that day.

Now, before that, about a year ago, I was in a different friend group, they'd always criticize me for being bad at sports (e.g. ""You're so fucking lazy and bad, you don't listen at all and can't even fucking get a goal without help."" because tbh I'm trash at sports) and say I'm a freak at times. Saying things like I attempted suicide for attention (when I was in a year group with like 50 people, gonna be famous cool kid now am I right?) and making suicide jokes themselves and putting their hands around my neck (not full on strangling but if tighter and with more pressure could be considered it) in front of everyone (in the friend group).

The thing is I also somewhat liked those people and like the current friend group as well because we somewhat got on well, chatted a lot, talked about stuff with them, and when I'd play games with them like football (the game I mention earlier with the new friend group) they would help me even though it's cheating and giving me an unfair advantage. Yet whenever I talk about me and my stuff nobody shows interest, ignoring it in the process and does not care unless it's making them feel better about themselves.

I get worked up over things such as people criticizing (not constructive) my stuff, making a joke about me, being ignored, saying I should do other things with my times, etc. The worst part is that I don't even know if I'm telling you (the reader) the right information or my mind warped it (I have not been diagnosed with anything and NZ mental health care is really bad).

Now there's news of another variant in the area and some oddly rapid action with door to door tests. When government reassurance tends to mean that you should worry (cause they aren't telling the whole truth), I'm not sure what to think and how to feel.

I cant for the life of me understand why international travel is still being allowed during a lockdown, or why they aren't compulsary quarantining everyone who arrives from abroad!!? 

Just reading the news is exhausting. (Hard to escape as well when it's everywhere)

This together with the boredom of lockdown (I'm running out of things I want to do) is becoming a bit too much now.

With how out of control things are in this country, I'm worried that getting the virus will become inevitable despite all the precautions my family is taking.

Saw an article the other day about a 25yr old teacher died suddenly after a positive COVID test. As my mother is a teacher, this terrifies me. Even more so when both my sister and I are in the same age bracket as that teacher, which suggests we might not be any less affected by the virus.

Oddly enough, I think my COCD and the effect on making me and my family more vigilant might be one of the few things protecting us now. I barely leave my bedroom most days.

I really wish I was living in NZ right now.

this is probably a trauma dump, sorry. i think i just want some other points of view and advice from people who have gone/going through something similar. (long post, like almost an autobiography haha)

its alright if you don't care most of this is probably unrelated but my bpd has effected me for so long and even writing this is a help for me. maybe i could help somebody else by doing this

**Because of my recent mental health journey I've become more self aware of how my childhood has effected me, it will be in bold. these are mainly just theory's from both professional's and i. if you notice any. please let me know :)**

the main issue i am currently facing is my sense of self.

**fuck i hope nobody from school finds this, if you do, please, please dont tell other people .**

So ill start this by saying thanks for bothering to read this. hopefully this whole post wont be grim, it should cheer up towards the end :) This is partly a vent and partly a cry for help and looking for advice in general. i think for you to truly get the picture i might have trauma dump a lot. in fact ill probably dump a large part of my life on here. So skip past if your not interested, maybe this is the wrong subreddit. but my current goal is self improvement. (let me know if there's a better place to post this) 

currently im 17. i turn 18 at the end of the month (really dont want to, spent the last couple birthdays alone and miserable. i dont want to do anything for my birthday. nothing interests me). i have diagnosed anxiety and not officially diagnosed bpd (the doctors told me i have it but didnt want to officially diagnose because of the possible effect it could have on my mental health. im reasonably on top of the symptoms now. but i just have no idea what to do with my life.

ill start with my parents. my mother as a child moved around a lot. her father was in Vietnam and it fucked him up a bit. he killed himself. he worked in Papua new guinea as a representative of Australia way back when.  her mother owned a range of different motels over the years, this is why she was always on the move. by 17 she had lived on three different country's. she probably has mental health issues but i dont think shes sure, shes probably only started thinking about it recently because of my mental health journey. im not sure if i should ask, its not really my place. we dont have that sort of relationship. she was never good at making friends. like me. she moved back to Australia from NZ when she was 17 by herself.

**mental health issues were in my genetics. my father had extreme anxiety and i suspect a personality disorder. (like myself). My brother which i talk about further on has depression and was hyperactive as a child. maybe even now. (adhd?? not particularly familiar)**

My father was what happens when a severely mentally ill person self medicates with alcohol. i dont know much about his past. mum never talks about him. he wasn't a good man. he nearly killed me and my older brother multiple times by accident when we were children because of his alcoholism (nearly crushing infant me while unconscious). i believe my mum has implied he had a lot of childhood trauma.

My parents divorced when i was three, my brother was five. after that my dad went downhill fast. he would drink 3-8 cases of beer a week at least. (keep in mind he was a truck driver). we would see him every other weekend. My mum has told me about how terrified she constantly was whenever he picked us up. he was always drunk. She recently told me the story of how there was a big news story of a man who threw his 2 sons of a bridge to their death. My father thought this was very funny. he would often joke about doing it to us while we were sitting in the car (he was standing just outside talking to my mum.) my mother suspected he did meth as well. which certainly isnt uncommon for truck drivers here in aus. My mum said that he never abused her but im not sure if i believe her. she said she divorced him the day he threatened to kill her.

He remarried when i was about 5. i dont remember that much about her. mum hated her. as kids we thought she was gross, she had only half her teeth, the other half where completely black. she stunk like cigarettes and alcohol. she would try and hug us goodbye but we would never let her. She would pick us up when dad was too drunk to drive. (imagine just how drunk he was for HIM to pull over) i dont think he ever drove sober. the road he would drive us on to his house was a windy dirt road, on the side of a very large hill. he would drive this very old four-wheel drive very erratically. my older brother got really motion sick and i would try my best to not look out the window. i was scared.

my father died in febuary 2009. he drank so much he suffered a stroke. it was my mothers happiest day of her life (she told me recently). Its hard for me to say this but it was for the best. i would probably be dead if my dad was still alive. my teacher showed up to the funeral, which was very nice of her. My mum never talked bad about my dad growing up, she thought it was wrong. the main issue was that there was almost no good to talk either. he was almost never mentioned most of my childhood.

**This is probably when my Borderline Personality Disorder started to develop. i believe i was a little bit narcissistic when i was 5/6/7.** **this is a typical response from a child with a pd. This is also when i started maladaptive daydreaming. i would have spent most of my youth doing this, like a lot.. probably around 80% of my day when i wasnt at school. 4+hours at a time. i still do it to get me to sleep. most of the time it revolves around me being less lonely. getting into a relationship. happiness.**

My brother turned into my male role model. i wanted to be like him.

 however when i was 7/8 my older brother started bullying me. it was pretty constant. he wasnt the type of bully to beat me up physically. he is extremely smart. a near perfect memory. when he graduated he was in the top 5% of students in the state. he did this without doing any homework or trying particularly hard. he new he could get into the engineering course he wanted, at any university he wanted. when it comes to bullying, he new exactly what buttons to press, when to press them, how to mostly get away with it. he loved it. This crushed me. my self esteem was low. i wanted to kill him. like really do it. but at that age (8) i new that that was going to worsen my life overall. so i turned to killing myself. i was suicidal at 8, 8! what the fuck happens to a child to cause him to be that fucked up. i begged my mother to stop him, just force him to go away. i used to be on my hands and knees tears running down my face saying 'just threaten to take his DS away' (remember those? thats a childhood memory for ya). she did a few times at the start. My would just behave for a few days and get it back. then the bullying would start again. after a while she just got sick of it. got sick of my begging. 'just ignore him', 'walk into the other room'. im a 8 yr old with an undiagnosed emotional instability issue, with an older brother who will just follow me into another room. i couldn't. 

**for a long time i felt phony. like my trauma didnt count because i wasnt being beaten or assault   in heinous ways. to be honest im probably self conscious of my trauma because i feel i got off easy, but im still fucked up.**

**my psychologist finds this period of my life interesting. the blend of looking up to him and him bullying me. He mentioned that it could have left me with an interesting and hard to describe mindset. Filling a role, like an actor. In theory my brother made me feel like it was my place, my role. like i am always searching for a role to fill. not necessarily one like this role (of being the bully's victim). also other roles. e.g. like playing a video game and being assigned an assault class, (or Overwatch is a great example if anyone has played that) does anybody else experience this. it effects my day dreams too. what is this called??**

after he got bored it kind of just stopped. the strategy of sending him to the other end of the house came into effect because he wanted it to. to this day we still dont really talk. ive lived with him for months at a time without saying a word. he recently moved out and comes and visits occasionally to see mum. we dont talk. i dont want to talk to him.

**because of this after the period of bullying i was extremely isolated. i didnt trust my mother, because she didnt help me. and didnt like my brother. Interestingly the effect my mother/brothers actions had left me with a distrust/hatred of authority. (not a great trait to have). i also believe that it could have been my mother along with these other factors that have heavily effected my ability to talk to girls. im high functioning bpd, so i can still cope with the day to day chats. but texting a girl is something i could not dream of doing. ive tried and im extremely boring (sense of self) and often say the wrong things :/ maybe i just need practice.**

**the feeling of being 'alone in your own home' translated to the outside world.**

**i was so socially isolated that i believe ive developed a chronic feeling of loneliness. im socially awkward. bad at making friends. but hate being alone. i also dont have a great sense of family**

*bear with me here, eventually the story will get a little brighter.* 

growing up we were never an active family. never out in the community (live in a small town of about 5000, 300 kids at my high school across 6 yr levels.) we never really went out and did stuff. mum was tired and we didnt have that much money. we were far from poor but thats probably because we didnt do stuff. we always had to budget you know. we never really went on holidays like the other kids. i joined scouts as a kid (little to no girls).

This is the part where i had a mostly normal childhood (8.5-12). i was still maladaptive daydreaming way too much. and i was becoming jealous of my friends having dads . Mum did a decent job at being both parents . i had friends, school. still isolating myself at home though. (give or take 11) I mentioned once before that i used to be suicidal. my family laughed at me, 'impossible' they said. i also referenced throughout the years my brothers bullying. my family laughed, they thought this too was ridiculous. 

when it came time to move to high school (start of seventh grade (12-13), Australians don't typically have middle schools). i desperately wanted to go to a different school than the one my mum wanted to send me too. my brother got a choice of schools much further away, why didn't i? mum sent me to the one i didnt want to go to.

This was the point my relationship with my mother went downhill. i hated her for this. we started to get into fights about everything. i quickly realized how different we were. like if she likes something, i will genuinely, prefer the exact opposite of that. This was not to spite my mother. i just genuinely did. we grew further apart.

later on i never said hi to her when she came home after work. just 'whats for dinner' and if the answer was a conversation i hated it. i hated the sound of her voice, her choice of words everything. but i faked the relationship for my own benefit. i cringed whenever she hugged or kissed me. it disgusted me. our relationship from her end was better than it had been, we certainly had our ups and downs (i couldnt keep the act up forever).

**i feel guilty for the shit i put her through, however she doesn't remember any of the shit i went through. she genuinely doesn't remember it as bullying she thought it only happened a few times. she doesn't remember laughing at me when i told her i was suicidal. she remembers me telling her. i remember it clear as day. i know this was not exacerbated in my head or by my bpd. ive extensively considered that option.** 

My mother has a bad memory. probably from smoking so much weed in her youth (apple didn't drop too far from the tree)

**looking back at it now i probably had minor-depression for a large part of my childhood. I thought i was mentally healthy up till 16.5.**

i quit scouts when i was about 14, tried refereeing football for a bit because i got paid. stopped when i was 16.

the school i attend is small. the town is too. some kids in my grade ive known since i was 3 who im about to graduate with. because of this my friend group has pretty much stayed the same. i haven't been exposed to many situations where ive had to make friends. the only hobbies i had growing up were video games. and nowadays i dont like them because of the position they've currently put me in. i never talked to anyone after school but there was a period 14-16 where i played ps4 with friends. back when i didnt have a worry in the world. i was so ignorant to not see what my lifestyle was setting me up for. fukc me. the town being so small also makes it difficult to find work. any other friends. relationships (probably to anxious to anyways). there's not many clubs. or groups. nothing im interested in. this town + social isolation has fucked me.

**the impact me growing up in this town can not be understated. i believe it is almost cruel to make a child grow up in a small town. i used to solely blame this for my lack of identity. but it a combination of both the bpd and the town. it is also very closed minded. i didnt realize how closed minded till i left for a few months. the kids here will make fun of each other for doing just about anything they enjoy. especially for trying hard at something. tall poppy syndrome??**

and at 16 i realized i didnt like living here, i set up a student exchange to the USA. it was a stressful couple of months prior. i had started taking Accutane and effected my mood negatively. setting up and exchange in a rush (i applied late because of my anxiety- at the time i didn't even recognize it as anxiety). she saw an opportunity to get rid of me for twelve months and she really wanted it.

i worked out, in January of 2020 i moved to usa to start my exchange year. i was so happy. 

**the filling a role mindset had found a place to thrive. the role of an Australian in America is an easy one. people just like you for being Australian. i didn't need a deeper personality. it was easy to make friends. obviously this was not sustainable in the long term >12 months.** 

**i think without somebody else i am boring. im dependent on them for my personality. not myself. inside im hollow.**

in America i experienced my first sense of family. not with the family i was living with. but with the other exchange student i was staying with. life was good. I STOPPED DAYDREAMING ALL TOGETHER. maybe it was because i constantly had company that i liked, maybe because i was just happy and didnt need it for happiness any more

**the family i was living with were strict and that doesn't work well with a distrust/hatred of authority.**

I think you can predict what happened next. Covid fucked up the exchange. all the money we spent on the exchange was lost. and i got sent back into the one place id finally for once gotten out of.

i never really noticed while i was there but my friends at home literally never talked to me. even if we had a group chat to send memes through not even one. ''how is it?''. i was happier. naturally more talkative. there was a couple of times i tried talking to them but they just killed the conversation pretty quick. 

i found out too late that these 'friends' were mostly just company. 

i got back to Australia and entered a deep depressive episode. i almost grabbed the wheel during the drive home and sent us into a tree. i spent the next couple of months stuck inside at home. i avoided self harm at first but did it here and there. 

**i knew i would feel differently after i did it, i would be filled with regret and a sudden urge to live. unintentionally i was playing on my reactive mood swings.**

This was the around the time i realized how fucked up i am. my past really caught up with me. when school came back to in-person my 'friends' found a new interest. joking about how depressed i looked. less then half asked if i was ok. and in the end all but two they didn't really care. to this day i don't think they do.

*ok it takes a pretty fucking long time before it gets better haha*

**my bpd really started effecting my thoughts. this is clearly a point in my life that was heavily filtered through the lens of bpd. the fear of abandonment was real. not just a fear, a reality. it stopped me from seeing the two did care. i took these negative feelings out on everything. mainly myself.** 

**self love is important and its taken up till literally a week ago to actually understand that.**

 ***i had to surpass my own ego and realize what's truly best for me. happiness. unconditional happiness. not just happiness while in the us, or for that matter anywhere thats not here. no conditions . no limitations. 'tap into the unlimited power within'.***

**i am by no means happy but this is the key. certainly easier said than done. this section\^ is also what's called a higher state of consciousness. looking at the big picture. bpd brings you down to a lower level through emotional instability, and for me black-and-white thinking. (all or nothing)**

im quite good at hiding my struggles to the outside world. reddit, my psych, and my councilor are the only ones that know the truth. high functioning. after about 5-6 months of visible depression i just went back to hiding it. over the course of the 8 months after coming home i would have dozens of self harm incidents. 3 attempts and would have pushed a knife against my wrist countless times. i thought about killing myself every day. i also cried every day for about 5 months, then again for another 3. this time of my life was tough. i never told the other foreign student i lived with about this. not in depth anyways. i didn't want to bother them.

at the end of 2020 after trying to find a way to move out for almost a year, i finally got the chance. however my mum could not decide whether she wanted me too or not. by this time. i just didnt talk to her at all. i was going to move to Newcastle, NSW. but finding a place to live when your'e 17 is difficult. i applied hundreds of times to different houses on Flatmates but only got a few replies. all saying no :/.   
 and between that and not being able to apply to real estate places because of my mothers flip-flopping i didnt find a house. i gave up after i had missed 5 weeks of the school year and searching 5+ hours a day. 

this is the moment where i gave up on my academics. there was no possible way i was going to be able to pass the school year to a high enough standard to be worth it and i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life anyways. i decided in order for me to get through the year i needed a hell of a lot more professional support and a shit load of weed.

**having no sense of self had effected me for many years prior to this. the weed an iteresting effect initially. i believe it raised my conciousness and made me much more self aware.** 

*i am not here to glorify drugs. in the long run the eventually started making me depressed because i was smoking 3+ times a day .*

i initially smoked 3 times a week. the weed effected me so much and i was so much happier. mainly on the days when i didn't smoke but it was still in my system. i loved it. i also started taking antidepressants around this time. they fucked me up bad. my stomach was heavily effected by them and i was vomiting around 30+ times a day. So i started smoking more. The more i smoked the less i vomited. soon i was smoking 5 days a week. 

To this day my stomach is broken. i cant drink anymore. i throw up after like 3 beers. its tough. i also get really sick when im anxious. and my stomach hurts. i dont eat enough still.

after two months of antidepressants i went to a psychiatrist and the told me i probably had BPD. this wasn't an official diagnoses because they were worried about how it being official would hurt my mental health. but he said 'if this feels like you, you probably have it'. 

I easily fit into 7/9 of the criteria. and the other two i did not probably because im incapable of getting myself into a relationship.

**can someone give me some advice here. im so scared im going to become an incel. i know im capable of feelings, just not here.** 

being told about bpd was such a sense of clarity. i like to describe it as only having half the puzzle pieces and just finding out where the other half went. putting them back into place is a different story though. i was placed on mood stabilizers. they gave me a sense of clarity. it was strange because they made me much more aware of my actions. my mood swings, black and white thinking. 

**i went back to he car and when i got in i told my mum abot the bpd. she said she thought that was the case. she never told me. that pissed me off. when i told her it stems from my childhood and trauma she scoffed at me 'what childhood trauma?'**

over the next 6 months i would learn to understand myself more. get along with the 'company' more often. there was no benefit to me in hating them. 

recently i started getting along with mum better. i dont enjoy conversations with her. we dont fight anymore though. Thats probably more due to the growing on her side than mine. 

i started to interact with the world. i noticed when i would comment on tik toks i would feel better. and when someone replied back it made me feel good in some way.

 the current problem im facing is that im graduating soon and have no idea what i want to do with my life. Ive dreamed about getting out of here for a long time. this is  bad environment for my mental health. however there is two sides to this coin, leaving and going. i want to leave but dont know where i want to go. or why 

**just recently i realized that this going side is more about making friends than seeing the world. how can one move away with the sole intention of making friends (keep in mind im bad at it). Are friends not a by product of life? not a by product of moving?** 

ive been thinking a lot about going to college in America or Canada. me not having a sense of self means i dont know what i want to study. im not stupid enough to spend that much money on purely trying to make friends. what is my next move? do i travel through Europe and see some old friends from my first exchange? will they still like me? is that going to help me find me?  please help 

do i have more of an identity than i think? is my limited social interaction stopping me from seeing that?

also im looking for ways to develop socially

thanks for reading this far. sorry for any mistakes.

im also trying to figure out the things i like in life. i like music, especially lil peep. his music really helped me when i was about to kill myself so many times. cant really listen to some of it as it makes me depressed but some of it makes me happy. (could be because i used it as a mood stabilizer during my depressive episode.) news and politics. travel. i guess thats about it.

i considered a degree in journalism but im bad at English and the pay is really shit and only expected to go down.",

I have OCD and severe depression. I ended up in a mental health facility in New Zealand a few days before Christmas. I called our crisis help line at 8pm when my parents took me to the ER, they arrived just after 1am. I was suicidal and going to do it. They gave me two quetiapine and sent me home. I made it to the parking lot before melting down so my dad took me back in.

I was voluntarily committed. Due to covid they wouldn't let my dad come with but they assured him it was fine. He reminded them that I have OCD and asked that they make sure it is clean and they said that it was all good. They were out of beds in all other areas so I was put in the observation room of the ward for people who had been committed by the courts. It was filthy. There was a bag of rubbish in the bathroom with dirty wet wipes, dirty coffee cups in the water dispenser and food and dirt all over the floors. The NZ health systems policy under covid is that every room needs to be sanitised between patients. This wasn't even cleaned. Don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting much. I knew our wards were old and run down but this well worse than my very low standards.

What really gets me is that when I asked them if they could clean it they said that ""under the mental health act it doesn't have to be clean"". They have a no photo policy, I took photos. I called my parents and they came and got me. I went in rational but suicidal and left on the verge of a panic attack.

I was told that when a room became available in another ward I would be contacted. They called my dad twice the next day while I was asleep not with a bed but for a check up and I have since not heard from them. My parents aren't mental health experts and had basically been on suicide watch for coming up 3 days with no sleep. I just wanted help but there is none.

A few days after getting home I got a note that my psychiatrist appointment had been pushed from the 20th of Jan to the 16th of Feb. My nurse saw me a couple of days after I was in then went on holiday. I saw her again on the 7th of Jan. Shes on holiday at the moment due back mid Feb. I get one appointment every two weeks with her. Sometimes I go more than a month with no contact. I get people have lives, but if your nurse goes on holiday even for extended periods you don't get a ""backup"" nurse to come see you.

I see an outside therapist once a fortnight through a charity who are not equipped to deal with severe mental health issues. I thought I was on the waiting list to see someone through the public system but I've waited over 6 months to no avail.

My optimistic opinion is that they don't care if you live or die. I won't share my pessimistic opinion. Don't get me wrong I've seen good people before. But the system is broken and not only have they not fixed it the government reforms have made it worse.

This isn't even the half of it.",

So during my first break I went to my friends and for a bit we were just talking about stuff, and then all of a sudden they started making fun of me for always being so *close* to them, being *right up against them*, having my shoes *touch* theirs, not leaning up against the wall like them and instead standing in the open by doing things like standing in a circle against each other (during covid). Then the bell rang.

After the bell rang once more for lunch I went back and my friends decided to play a game (we play it because for some reason people still like playing it), so one of my friends said I should be in, then someone mentioned someone else not being in ""for ever"", that person then complains about it and says it should be me, I and another say we both could be since we are both pretty bad, then they decide on counting to 21. It of course lands on me being in, then one of them tells me to count for 90 seconds which I complain about because nobody else counts for 90 seconds, however it's just dismissed. Afterwards I count for a minute because that is the usual, so I start to chase after them then when I catch up, one of them complains about me not counting for a minute, the other says I was supposed to count for 90 seconds, consequently I decide to do something better with my time.

After all of that I notice they keep coming to the area around my classroom but I'm not sure if it's they want to apologize, poke more fun at more, or anything else? As a result I ran from the area until the bell rang for the penultimate time that day.

Now, before that, about a year ago, I was in a different friend group, they'd always criticize me for being bad at sports (e.g. ""You're so fucking lazy and bad, you don't listen at all and can't even fucking get a goal without help."" because tbh I'm trash at sports) and say I'm a freak at times. Saying things like I attempted suicide for attention (when I was in a year group with like 50 people, gonna be famous cool kid now am I right?) and making suicide jokes themselves and putting their hands around my neck (not full on strangling but if tighter and with more pressure could be considered it) in front of everyone (in the friend group).

The thing is I also somewhat liked those people and like the current friend group as well because we somewhat got on well, chatted a lot, talked about stuff with them, and when I'd play games with them like football (the game I mention earlier with the new friend group) they would help me even though it's cheating and giving me an unfair advantage. Yet whenever I talk about me and my stuff nobody shows interest, ignoring it in the process and does not care unless it's making them feel better about themselves.

I get worked up over things such as people criticizing (not constructive) my stuff, making a joke about me, being ignored, saying I should do other things with my times, etc. The worst part is that I don't even know if I'm telling you (the reader) the right information or my mind warped it (I have not been diagnosed with anything and NZ mental health care is really bad).

But please, give me some advice and just help me.",

Now there's news of another variant in the area and some oddly rapid action with door to door tests. When government reassurance tends to mean that you should worry (cause they aren't telling the whole truth), I'm not sure what to think and how to feel.

I cant for the life of me understand why international travel is still being allowed during a lockdown, or why they aren't compulsary quarantining everyone who arrives from abroad!!? 

Just reading the news is exhausting. (Hard to escape as well when it's everywhere)

This together with the boredom of lockdown (I'm running out of things I want to do) is becoming a bit too much now.

With how out of control things are in this country, I'm worried that getting the virus will become inevitable despite all the precautions my family is taking.

Saw an article the other day about a 25yr old teacher died suddenly after a positive COVID test. As my mother is a teacher, this terrifies me. Even more so when both my sister and I are in the same age bracket as that teacher, which suggests we might not be any less affected by the virus.

Oddly enough, I think my COCD and the effect on making me and my family more vigilant might be one of the few things protecting us now. I barely leave my bedroom most days.

I really wish I was living in NZ right now.

this is probably a trauma dump, sorry. i think i just want some other points of view and advice from people who have gone/going through something similar. (long post, like almost an autobiography haha)

its alright if you don't care most of this is probably unrelated but my bpd has effected me for so long and even writing this is a help for me. maybe i could help somebody else by doing this

**Because of my recent mental health journey I've become more self aware of how my childhood has effected me, it will be in bold. these are mainly just theory's from both professional's and i. if you notice any. please let me know :)**

the main issue i am currently facing is my sense of self.

**fuck i hope nobody from school finds this, if you do, please, please dont tell other people .**

So ill start this by saying thanks for bothering to read this. hopefully this whole post wont be grim, it should cheer up towards the end :) This is partly a vent and partly a cry for help and looking for advice in general. i think for you to truly get the picture i might have trauma dump a lot. in fact ill probably dump a large part of my life on here. So skip past if your not interested, maybe this is the wrong subreddit. but my current goal is self improvement. (let me know if there's a better place to post this) 

currently im 17. i turn 18 at the end of the month (really dont want to, spent the last couple birthdays alone and miserable. i dont want to do anything for my birthday. nothing interests me). i have diagnosed anxiety and not officially diagnosed bpd (the doctors told me i have it but didnt want to officially diagnose because of the possible effect it could have on my mental health. im reasonably on top of the symptoms now. but i just have no idea what to do with my life.

ill start with my parents. my mother as a child moved around a lot. her father was in Vietnam and it fucked him up a bit. he killed himself. he worked in Papua new guinea as a representative of Australia way back when.  her mother owned a range of different motels over the years, this is why she was always on the move. by 17 she had lived on three different country's. she probably has mental health issues but i dont think shes sure, shes probably only started thinking about it recently because of my mental health journey. im not sure if i should ask, its not really my place. we dont have that sort of relationship. she was never good at making friends. like me. she moved back to Australia from NZ when she was 17 by herself.

**mental health issues were in my genetics. my father had extreme anxiety and i suspect a personality disorder. (like myself). My brother which i talk about further on has depression and was hyperactive as a child. maybe even now. (adhd?? not particularly familiar)**

My father was what happens when a severely mentally ill person self medicates with alcohol. i dont know much about his past. mum never talks about him. he wasn't a good man. he nearly killed me and my older brother multiple times by accident when we were children because of his alcoholism (nearly crushing infant me while unconscious). i believe my mum has implied he had a lot of childhood trauma.

My parents divorced when i was three, my brother was five. after that my dad went downhill fast. he would drink 3-8 cases of beer a week at least. (keep in mind he was a truck driver). we would see him every other weekend. My mum has told me about how terrified she constantly was whenever he picked us up. he was always drunk. She recently told me the story of how there was a big news story of a man who threw his 2 sons of a bridge to their death. My father thought this was very funny. he would often joke about doing it to us while we were sitting in the car (he was standing just outside talking to my mum.) my mother suspected he did meth as well. which certainly isnt uncommon for truck drivers here in aus. My mum said that he never abused her but im not sure if i believe her. she said she divorced him the day he threatened to kill her.

He remarried when i was about 5. i dont remember that much about her. mum hated her. as kids we thought she was gross, she had only half her teeth, the other half where completely black. she stunk like cigarettes and alcohol. she would try and hug us goodbye but we would never let her. She would pick us up when dad was too drunk to drive. (imagine just how drunk he was for HIM to pull over) i dont think he ever drove sober. the road he would drive us on to his house was a windy dirt road, on the side of a very large hill. he would drive this very old four-wheel drive very erratically. my older brother got really motion sick and i would try my best to not look out the window. i was scared.

my father died in febuary 2009. he drank so much he suffered a stroke. it was my mothers happiest day of her life (she told me recently). Its hard for me to say this but it was for the best. i would probably be dead if my dad was still alive. my teacher showed up to the funeral, which was very nice of her. My mum never talked bad about my dad growing up, she thought it was wrong. the main issue was that there was almost no good to talk either. he was almost never mentioned most of my childhood.

**This is probably when my Borderline Personality Disorder started to develop. i believe i was a little bit narcissistic when i was 5/6/7.** **this is a typical response from a child with a pd. This is also when i started maladaptive daydreaming. i would have spent most of my youth doing this, like a lot.. probably around 80% of my day when i wasnt at school. 4+hours at a time. i still do it to get me to sleep. most of the time it revolves around me being less lonely. getting into a relationship. happiness.**

My brother turned into my male role model. i wanted to be like him.

 however when i was 7/8 my older brother started bullying me. it was pretty constant. he wasnt the type of bully to beat me up physically. he is extremely smart. a near perfect memory. when he graduated he was in the top 5% of students in the state. he did this without doing any homework or trying particularly hard. he new he could get into the engineering course he wanted, at any university he wanted. when it comes to bullying, he new exactly what buttons to press, when to press them, how to mostly get away with it. he loved it. This crushed me. my self esteem was low. i wanted to kill him. like really do it. but at that age (8) i new that that was going to worsen my life overall. so i turned to killing myself. i was suicidal at 8, 8! what the fuck happens to a child to cause him to be that fucked up. i begged my mother to stop him, just force him to go away. i used to be on my hands and knees tears running down my face saying 'just threaten to take his DS away' (remember those? thats a childhood memory for ya). she did a few times at the start. My would just behave for a few days and get it back. then the bullying would start again. after a while she just got sick of it. got sick of my begging. 'just ignore him', 'walk into the other room'. im a 8 yr old with an undiagnosed emotional instability issue, with an older brother who will just follow me into another room. i couldn't. 

**for a long time i felt phony. like my trauma didnt count because i wasnt being beaten or assault   in heinous ways. to be honest im probably self conscious of my trauma because i feel i got off easy, but im still fucked up.**

**my psychologist finds this period of my life interesting. the blend of looking up to him and him bullying me. He mentioned that it could have left me with an interesting and hard to describe mindset. Filling a role, like an actor. In theory my brother made me feel like it was my place, my role. like i am always searching for a role to fill. not necessarily one like this role (of being the bully's victim). also other roles. e.g. like playing a video game and being assigned an assault class, (or Overwatch is a great example if anyone has played that) does anybody else experience this. it effects my day dreams too. what is this called??**

after he got bored it kind of just stopped. the strategy of sending him to the other end of the house came into effect because he wanted it to. to this day we still dont really talk. ive lived with him for months at a time without saying a word. he recently moved out and comes and visits occasionally to see mum. we dont talk. i dont want to talk to him.

**because of this after the period of bullying i was extremely isolated. i didnt trust my mother, because she didnt help me. and didnt like my brother. Interestingly the effect my mother/brothers actions had left me with a distrust/hatred of authority. (not a great trait to have). i also believe that it could have been my mother along with these other factors that have heavily effected my ability to talk to girls. im high functioning bpd, so i can still cope with the day to day chats. but texting a girl is something i could not dream of doing. ive tried and im extremely boring (sense of self) and often say the wrong things :/ maybe i just need practice.**

**the feeling of being 'alone in your own home' translated to the outside world.**

**i was so socially isolated that i believe ive developed a chronic feeling of loneliness. im socially awkward. bad at making friends. but hate being alone. i also dont have a great sense of family**

*bear with me here, eventually the story will get a little brighter.* 

growing up we were never an active family. never out in the community (live in a small town of about 5000, 300 kids at my high school across 6 yr levels.) we never really went out and did stuff. mum was tired and we didnt have that much money. we were far from poor but thats probably because we didnt do stuff. we always had to budget you know. we never really went on holidays like the other kids. i joined scouts as a kid (little to no girls).

This is the part where i had a mostly normal childhood (8.5-12). i was still maladaptive daydreaming way too much. and i was becoming jealous of my friends having dads . Mum did a decent job at being both parents . i had friends, school. still isolating myself at home though. (give or take 11) I mentioned once before that i used to be suicidal. my family laughed at me, 'impossible' they said. i also referenced throughout the years my brothers bullying. my family laughed, they thought this too was ridiculous. 

when it came time to move to high school (start of seventh grade (12-13), Australians don't typically have middle schools). i desperately wanted to go to a different school than the one my mum wanted to send me too. my brother got a choice of schools much further away, why didn't i? mum sent me to the one i didnt want to go to.

This was the point my relationship with my mother went downhill. i hated her for this. we started to get into fights about everything. i quickly realized how different we were. like if she likes something, i will genuinely, prefer the exact opposite of that. This was not to spite my mother. i just genuinely did. we grew further apart.

later on i never said hi to her when she came home after work. just 'whats for dinner' and if the answer was a conversation i hated it. i hated the sound of her voice, her choice of words everything. but i faked the relationship for my own benefit. i cringed whenever she hugged or kissed me. it disgusted me. our relationship from her end was better than it had been, we certainly had our ups and downs (i couldnt keep the act up forever).

**i feel guilty for the shit i put her through, however she doesn't remember any of the shit i went through. she genuinely doesn't remember it as bullying she thought it only happened a few times. she doesn't remember laughing at me when i told her i was suicidal. she remembers me telling her. i remember it clear as day. i know this was not exacerbated in my head or by my bpd. ive extensively considered that option.** 

My mother has a bad memory. probably from smoking so much weed in her youth (apple didn't drop too far from the tree)

**looking back at it now i probably had minor-depression for a large part of my childhood. I thought i was mentally healthy up till 16.5.**

i quit scouts when i was about 14, tried refereeing football for a bit because i got paid. stopped when i was 16.

the school i attend is small. the town is too. some kids in my grade ive known since i was 3 who im about to graduate with. because of this my friend group has pretty much stayed the same. i haven't been exposed to many situations where ive had to make friends. the only hobbies i had growing up were video games. and nowadays i dont like them because of the position they've currently put me in. i never talked to anyone after school but there was a period 14-16 where i played ps4 with friends. back when i didnt have a worry in the world. i was so ignorant to not see what my lifestyle was setting me up for. fukc me. the town being so small also makes it difficult to find work. any other friends. relationships (probably to anxious to anyways). there's not many clubs. or groups. nothing im interested in. this town + social isolation has fucked me.

**the impact me growing up in this town can not be understated. i believe it is almost cruel to make a child grow up in a small town. i used to solely blame this for my lack of identity. but it a combination of both the bpd and the town. it is also very closed minded. i didnt realize how closed minded till i left for a few months. the kids here will make fun of each other for doing just about anything they enjoy. especially for trying hard at something. tall poppy syndrome??**

and at 16 i realized i didnt like living here, i set up a student exchange to the USA. it was a stressful couple of months prior. i had started taking Accutane and effected my mood negatively. setting up and exchange in a rush (i applied late because of my anxiety- at the time i didn't even recognize it as anxiety). she saw an opportunity to get rid of me for twelve months and she really wanted it.

i worked out, in January of 2020 i moved to usa to start my exchange year. i was so happy. 

**the filling a role mindset had found a place to thrive. the role of an Australian in America is an easy one. people just like you for being Australian. i didn't need a deeper personality. it was easy to make friends. obviously this was not sustainable in the long term >12 months.** 

**i think without somebody else i am boring. im dependent on them for my personality. not myself. inside im hollow.**

in America i experienced my first sense of family. not with the family i was living with. but with the other exchange student i was staying with. life was good. I STOPPED DAYDREAMING ALL TOGETHER. maybe it was because i constantly had company that i liked, maybe because i was just happy and didnt need it for happiness any more

**the family i was living with were strict and that doesn't work well with a distrust/hatred of authority.**

I think you can predict what happened next. Covid fucked up the exchange. all the money we spent on the exchange was lost. and i got sent back into the one place id finally for once gotten out of.

i never really noticed while i was there but my friends at home literally never talked to me. even if we had a group chat to send memes through not even one. ''how is it?''. i was happier. naturally more talkative. there was a couple of times i tried talking to them but they just killed the conversation pretty quick. 

i found out too late that these 'friends' were mostly just company. 

i got back to Australia and entered a deep depressive episode. i almost grabbed the wheel during the drive home and sent us into a tree. i spent the next couple of months stuck inside at home. i avoided self harm at first but did it here and there. 

**i knew i would feel differently after i did it, i would be filled with regret and a sudden urge to live. unintentionally i was playing on my reactive mood swings.**

This was the around the time i realized how fucked up i am. my past really caught up with me. when school came back to in-person my 'friends' found a new interest. joking about how depressed i looked. less then half asked if i was ok. and in the end all but two they didn't really care. to this day i don't think they do.

*ok it takes a pretty fucking long time before it gets better haha*

**my bpd really started effecting my thoughts. this is clearly a point in my life that was heavily filtered through the lens of bpd. the fear of abandonment was real. not just a fear, a reality. it stopped me from seeing the two did care. i took these negative feelings out on everything. mainly myself.** 

**self love is important and its taken up till literally a week ago to actually understand that.**

 ***i had to surpass my own ego and realize what's truly best for me. happiness. unconditional happiness. not just happiness while in the us, or for that matter anywhere thats not here. no conditions . no limitations. 'tap into the unlimited power within'.***

**i am by no means happy but this is the key. certainly easier said than done. this section\^ is also what's called a higher state of consciousness. looking at the big picture. bpd brings you down to a lower level through emotional instability, and for me black-and-white thinking. (all or nothing)**

im quite good at hiding my struggles to the outside world. reddit, my psych, and my councilor are the only ones that know the truth. high functioning. after about 5-6 months of visible depression i just went back to hiding it. over the course of the 8 months after coming home i would have dozens of self harm incidents. 3 attempts and would have pushed a knife against my wrist countless times. i thought about killing myself every day. i also cried every day for about 5 months, then again for another 3. this time of my life was tough. i never told the other foreign student i lived with about this. not in depth anyways. i didn't want to bother them.

at the end of 2020 after trying to find a way to move out for almost a year, i finally got the chance. however my mum could not decide whether she wanted me too or not. by this time. i just didnt talk to her at all. i was going to move to Newcastle, NSW. but finding a place to live when your'e 17 is difficult. i applied hundreds of times to different houses on Flatmates but only got a few replies. all saying no :/.   
 and between that and not being able to apply to real estate places because of my mothers flip-flopping i didnt find a house. i gave up after i had missed 5 weeks of the school year and searching 5+ hours a day. 

this is the moment where i gave up on my academics. there was no possible way i was going to be able to pass the school year to a high enough standard to be worth it and i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life anyways. i decided in order for me to get through the year i needed a hell of a lot more professional support and a shit load of weed.

**having no sense of self had effected me for many years prior to this. the weed an iteresting effect initially. i believe it raised my conciousness and made me much more self aware.** 

*i am not here to glorify drugs. in the long run the eventually started making me depressed because i was smoking 3+ times a day .*

i initially smoked 3 times a week. the weed effected me so much and i was so much happier. mainly on the days when i didn't smoke but it was still in my system. i loved it. i also started taking antidepressants around this time. they fucked me up bad. my stomach was heavily effected by them and i was vomiting around 30+ times a day. So i started smoking more. The more i smoked the less i vomited. soon i was smoking 5 days a week. 

To this day my stomach is broken. i cant drink anymore. i throw up after like 3 beers. its tough. i also get really sick when im anxious. and my stomach hurts. i dont eat enough still.

after two months of antidepressants i went to a psychiatrist and the told me i probably had BPD. this wasn't an official diagnoses because they were worried about how it being official would hurt my mental health. but he said 'if this feels like you, you probably have it'. 

I easily fit into 7/9 of the criteria. and the other two i did not probably because im incapable of getting myself into a relationship.

**can someone give me some advice here. im so scared im going to become an incel. i know im capable of feelings, just not here.** 

being told about bpd was such a sense of clarity. i like to describe it as only having half the puzzle pieces and just finding out where the other half went. putting them back into place is a different story though. i was placed on mood stabilizers. they gave me a sense of clarity. it was strange because they made me much more aware of my actions. my mood swings, black and white thinking. 

**i went back to he car and when i got in i told my mum abot the bpd. she said she thought that was the case. she never told me. that pissed me off. when i told her it stems from my childhood and trauma she scoffed at me 'what childhood trauma?'**

over the next 6 months i would learn to understand myself more. get along with the 'company' more often. there was no benefit to me in hating them. 

recently i started getting along with mum better. i dont enjoy conversations with her. we dont fight anymore though. Thats probably more due to the growing on her side than mine. 

i started to interact with the world. i noticed when i would comment on tik toks i would feel better. and when someone replied back it made me feel good in some way.

 the current problem im facing is that im graduating soon and have no idea what i want to do with my life. Ive dreamed about getting out of here for a long time. this is  bad environment for my mental health. however there is two sides to this coin, leaving and going. i want to leave but dont know where i want to go. or why 

**just recently i realized that this going side is more about making friends than seeing the world. how can one move away with the sole intention of making friends (keep in mind im bad at it). Are friends not a by product of life? not a by product of moving?** 

ive been thinking a lot about going to college in America or Canada. me not having a sense of self means i dont know what i want to study. im not stupid enough to spend that much money on purely trying to make friends. what is my next move? do i travel through Europe and see some old friends from my first exchange? will they still like me? is that going to help me find me?  please help 

do i have more of an identity than i think? is my limited social interaction stopping me from seeing that?

also im looking for ways to develop socially

thanks for reading this far. sorry for any mistakes.

im also trying to figure out the things i like in life. i like music, especially lil peep. his music really helped me when i was about to kill myself so many times. cant really listen to some of it as it makes me depressed but some of it makes me happy. (could be because i used it as a mood stabilizer during my depressive episode.) news and politics. travel. i guess thats about it.

i considered a degree in journalism but im bad at English and the pay is really shit and only expected to go down.",

I have OCD and severe depression. I ended up in a mental health facility in New Zealand a few days before Christmas. I called our crisis help line at 8pm when my parents took me to the ER, they arrived just after 1am. I was suicidal and going to do it. They gave me two quetiapine and sent me home. I made it to the parking lot before melting down so my dad took me back in.

I was voluntarily committed. Due to covid they wouldn't let my dad come with but they assured him it was fine. He reminded them that I have OCD and asked that they make sure it is clean and they said that it was all good. They were out of beds in all other areas so I was put in the observation room of the ward for people who had been committed by the courts. It was filthy. There was a bag of rubbish in the bathroom with dirty wet wipes, dirty coffee cups in the water dispenser and food and dirt all over the floors. The NZ health systems policy under covid is that every room needs to be sanitised between patients. This wasn't even cleaned. Don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting much. I knew our wards were old and run down but this well worse than my very low standards.

What really gets me is that when I asked them if they could clean it they said that ""under the mental health act it doesn't have to be clean"". They have a no photo policy, I took photos. I called my parents and they came and got me. I went in rational but suicidal and left on the verge of a panic attack.

I was told that when a room became available in another ward I would be contacted. They called my dad twice the next day while I was asleep not with a bed but for a check up and I have since not heard from them. My parents aren't mental health experts and had basically been on suicide watch for coming up 3 days with no sleep. I just wanted help but there is none.

A few days after getting home I got a note that my psychiatrist appointment had been pushed from the 20th of Jan to the 16th of Feb. My nurse saw me a couple of days after I was in then went on holiday. I saw her again on the 7th of Jan. Shes on holiday at the moment due back mid Feb. I get one appointment every two weeks with her. Sometimes I go more than a month with no contact. I get people have lives, but if your nurse goes on holiday even for extended periods you don't get a ""backup"" nurse to come see you.

I see an outside therapist once a fortnight through a charity who are not equipped to deal with severe mental health issues. I thought I was on the waiting list to see someone through the public system but I've waited over 6 months to no avail.

My optimistic opinion is that they don't care if you live or die. I won't share my pessimistic opinion. Don't get me wrong I've seen good people before. But the system is broken and not only have they not fixed it the government reforms have made it worse.

This isn't even the half of it.",
01/07/2020,1660950526-31174,"https://camas.unddit.com/#{%22subreddit%22:%22MentalHealth%22,%22searchFor%22:1,%22resultSize%22:100,%22query%22:%22covid%20nz%22}","Earlier today I was spending some with my friends (normal) in my school breaks. So during my first break I went to my friends and for a bit we were just talking about stuff, and then all of a sudden they started making fun of me for always being so *close* to them, being *right up against them*, having my shoes *touch* theirs, not leaning up against the wall like them and instead standing in the open by doing things like standing in a circle against each other (during covid). Then the bell rang.

After the bell rang once more for lunch I went back and my friends decided to play a game (we play it because for some reason people still like playing it), so one of my friends said I should be in, then someone mentioned someone else not being in ""for ever"", that person then complains about it and says it should be me, I and another say we both could be since we are both pretty bad, then they decide on counting to 21. It of course lands on me being in, then one of them tells me to count for 90 seconds which I complain about because nobody else counts for 90 seconds, however it's just dismissed. Afterwards I count for a minute because that is the usual, so I start to chase after them then when I catch up, one of them complains about me not counting for a minute, the other says I was supposed to count for 90 seconds, consequently I decide to do something better with my time.

After all of that I notice they keep coming to the area around my classroom but I'm not sure if it's they want to apologize, poke more fun at more, or anything else? As a result I ran from the area until the bell rang for the penultimate time that day.

Now, before that, about a year ago, I was in a different friend group, they'd always criticize me for being bad at sports (e.g. ""You're so fucking lazy and bad, you don't listen at all and can't even fucking get a goal without help."" because tbh I'm trash at sports) and say I'm a freak at times. Saying things like I attempted suicide for attention (when I was in a year group with like 50 people, gonna be famous cool kid now am I right?) and making suicide jokes themselves and putting their hands around my neck (not full on strangling but if tighter and with more pressure could be considered it) in front of everyone (in the friend group).

The thing is I also somewhat liked those people and like the current friend group as well because we somewhat got on well, chatted a lot, talked about stuff with them, and when I'd play games with them like football (the game I mention earlier with the new friend group) they would help me even though it's cheating and giving me an unfair advantage. Yet whenever I talk about me and my stuff nobody shows interest, ignoring it in the process and does not care unless it's making them feel better about themselves.

I get worked up over things such as people criticizing (not constructive) my stuff, making a joke about me, being ignored, saying I should do other things with my times, etc. The worst part is that I don't even know if I'm telling you (the reader) the right information or my mind warped it (I have not been diagnosed with anything and NZ mental health care is really bad).

Morrison does not rule out making tracing app compulsory

The coronavirus mobile tracing app will be key to containing the virus, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says, as the federal government ramps up its campaign for Australians to agree to have their movements logged.

The mobile app can alert Australians to the risk of catching the coronavirus, using their movements to find out whether they have been close to someone already infected.

Once it is developed, the app will be downloaded by Australians voluntarily and will enable information about their movements to be ""uploaded immediately to the public health unit"", whereas the manual tracing process can take days.

I'm in Australia (Gold Coast) and it's been almost 2 years since I've been able to visit my home state and 95% of my friends. I'd always flown back and forth 2-3 times a year, but now I can't because even during the brief windows when none of the states are in lockdown, the risk of a sudden lockdown looms. I've already tried to book flights twice and had to cancel them twice.



I usually go overseas every year. Last year I'd booked a 7 week trip to the USA, 12 states, visiting some of my favourite places and seeing some friends. I had to cancel all of that and I still can't even think about re-booking.



It was my 43rd birthday on Wednesday, and it was very quiet with just my parents and my partner, but it was lovely. Back in June, for some ridiculous reason I thought MAYBE my partner and I might be able to book tickets to see my favourite comedian an hour away in Brisbane, stay in a hotel, have a nice dinner and such. A very small overnight ""getaway"" that would be the furthest I'd have travelled since 2019.



We were supposed to go tomorrow. But nope. Today, it was cancelled because of sudden multiple Covid outbreaks in Brisbane and the Gold Coast just days prior, after months of relative calm. Why? Why NOW?



Why did I even bother to hope to be able to do anything? I sleep all day most days because I'm so depressed and don't have any interest or enjoyment in things, and I feel like the universe is saying to me ""Yeah. Stay down. Stay in bed, because you're never going to be able to do anything again. Just give up."" And I have. I already barely go out anywhere as I just don't want to. I feel mostly dead inside.



And I'm one of the lucky ones. My friends in Melbourne and Sydney have been in lockdown for months and are much worse off than me.



I worry constantly about my parents, who are in their 70s. We're all fully vaccinated but I still don't feel safe.



One of the very few friends I have here in my state is 83 years old and in a nursing home, and nobody can visit her right now, yet again. We've been meaning to take her out shopping and to lunch, but every time we try, restrictions on visiting nursing homes appear again and we can't. She also can't get vaccinated due to past brain bleeds, so I worry about her being vulnerable to Covid.



I just can't believe this is my life. Masks being worn everywhere. Everything closed down as restaurants and shops couldn't survive after so long living with restrictions and repetitive lockdowns.



I once had hope that after I was vaccinated, I could maybe soon travel, even a small distance. But no. I then had hope that once 80% of the population was vaccinated that things would change. But I now see that was naive as Singapore, one of the highest vaccinated countries in the world, is back into restrictions again due to a surge in cases up to 6,000 a day. HOW is this EVER going to end!?



Is this just IT now? This is life? Are people like my 83 year old friend going to have lived a full life and then BAM!!! For their precious last few years...it's THIS? THIS is how it ends? Alone in a nursing home without even her family allowed to visit? I just can't comprehend how tragic that is.

She thinks why the vaccine not certain yet and dare to jab people before they get covid...????



I mean the theories itself is not 100% certain, I know vaccine is also not 100% protected against covid but and this is nothing about freedom of choice, but if our freedom of choice made other people sick then its trespass against other people who follows health protocols strictly. 



I don't agree people who refuse to get the vaccine is fired in their jobs and I don't agree hospitals refuse people who get sick because they refuse to get vaccine. And I don't agree people get ostracized because they refuse to get the vaccine for whatever reasons they have (conspiracy theories, health, religion, phobias, etc...)--> although this might be difficult when we faced them directly...and they had might injure our loved one or us...????

My anxiety has reached its high point again  we've been told here in Perth WA, Australia, that we need to be on lock-down for this week (currently on day 3). Someone was reported having COVID on the weekend just gone & just when we thought we've done well/out of the woods, everyone has to stay at home again. For the most part, people have been following orders/restrictions well and there's been no new cases of the virus so far - which is a good thing. Of course there are some that just don't follow the rules & makes it frustrating for us when we're trying to get thru this again so we can return to normal & work. 



Day 3 of this lock-down and I'm already extremely bored - my workplace has remained open for the essential workers, police have confirmed with us that we are okay to keep running provided we continue following health restrictions etc. But due to lots of people cancelling & not many showing up, only full-timers are working this week. As I'm currently a casual, I'm bored stuck at home even though I have plenty of things to occupy me, I'm just not interested enough to keep focused on it. I hate being in the house for long periods of time as I end up getting too far into my head & become depressed. I'm hoping this lock-down will only last until Friday like the PM said, then we can slowly ease back into returning things to normal. If it ends going on for a longer period, then I'll have to be back on Centrelink till further notice. 



On top of COVID hitting us again here, we've also had bush fires happening here over last couple of days. Lots of properties have been damaged/destroyed, people have been evacuated (some even during the early hours of morning) and animals have been taken to other properties in safer areas. Pretty smokey as the winds carry it round, ash has also been falling elsewhere but thankfully my family & myself are not in the danger zone. We've prepared bags of clothes, food etc packed in the car ready to leave if we have to. My heart goes out to all those that are effected, I hope my friends/family members that live that way have safely been evacuated & I also hope that the amazing firefighters will get this devastating fire under control ASAP. 



Sorry for the long post but just needed to get this off my chest, don't really have many people to confide into anymore. Only my partner really but can't return home atm as I've been staying with family & am stuck here till lock-down ends  I hope the rest of you are okay, wherever in the world you are <3",
01/07/2020,,https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/coping-skills-during-lockdown.273343/,"I have Complex PTSD, Schizophrenia, and Dependency Personality Disorder and am finding it hard during lockdown to not be around people but I have some awesome supports. Some of the coping skills I have been taught and ones I found myself I thought I could share so here they are:

Deep breathing
Doing something nice and self-nurturing for yourself
Rub some nice hand creams into your hands
Treat yourself to something nice that does not have to cost too much
Pray
If anxious distract yourself with something like doing something creative, writing or watching a movie or good TV channel - distraction is great to get away from anxious thoughts and get your mind on something else
Write in your journal
Write a gratitude journal
Notice some ""warm"" things like warm tones of colours around you, plants or nature to the sky if artificial things are making you anxious
Listen to your favourite music instead of watching the news sometimes
Do something creative - cut out pictures and make cards
Send a card to someone who has been kind to you thanking them
Go for a walk and practice some mindfulness about things around you - noticing the patterns on the trunks of the trees, and types of flowers in the gardens etc.
Cry and know it is okay to feel sad - many others are too but know you are important and valuable but never be hard on yourself
Know that this too shall pass
Be kind to yourself and others
If stressed take just a few small gentle steps at a time like walking around the block in one go, and next tidying your room etc
Keep taking your medications and vitamins as that will keep you well
Join a Neighbourhood Support Group to support your own and other's safety
Ring a friend and have a chat
Ring the phone lines like 1737 or Lifeline for a chat or Mental Health Line
Know you are important and matter to so many people going through similar things
Give yourself a pat on your back and practice self-compassion - you have been through a lot and have a lot of value
Stay in contact with friends and family who you can trust and get on with
Know you have many strengths and qualities - write them down and if you want to put it on the wall
Know you are not in this alone!

Keep practising social distancing, wearing face masks if you can get them (and they are difficult to get hold of so it is okay if you do not have some), washing hands regularly, staying at home as much as possible apart from going for walks and eating healthily to build up your immune system.

We will get through this.

Hope this is all helpful - I will post more over the next few weeks when I think of them.

We have just under 3 months left of 2020, and I wish I could celebrate letting go of what may be the most mentally challenging year of my life, but alas it's not that simple. I won't be able to let go of the pain left by a year with the turn of a calendar. Because our society seems to be obsessed with being bitter about the past to the point where they refuse to move on, and let it ruin our present and future. This year my faith in society has declined even more than before, because I've seen the negativity, toxicity and hate in society triggered by 2020. It's really brought out the worst in people. And people aren't gonna adopt a better attitude just because it's a new year; they're gonna keep digging humanity into a pit of self-destruction. Nobody seems aware that all this hate we are spreading is making the world an even harder place to live than it needs to be, and I'm worried that people are gonna make our situation worse instead of better, and on purpose. Lately I have been really scared that by the end of the year, an extremist movement across western civilization will emerge where people will go around deliberately infecting millions of people with covid to cause the numbers to shoot up higher than ever, because they are sick of humanity and want to put us out of our misery because they've decided that we are too far gone to ever be saved, and things will never get better. I'm terrified that the US election in a month could be the trigger that would cause this genocidal movement, because people will think that the world can never recover from 2020. For years now I have been psychologically manipulated by what other people say. My entire mental wellbeing is solely determined by other people, meaning I have no control over it. This is how our generation has been taught how to act; being manipulated and pushed around by others to the point of letting them ruin our lives. It's such a shame that today's youth feels like they have to forever be mentally broken and dysfunctional because the world is a horrible place that is crushing our spirit. More people should be advocating for mental wellbeing for all of humanity, but instead too many people are just bringing each other down. I've tried so hard to be positive and brave for years, but society just keeps beating me down and it keeps getting harder for me to get back up and keep fighting in the world.

I've been getting super annoyed at my friends for no reason (i don't tell them this though, I just talk to them as normal because I'd feel too bad if I said something or if I just ignore them).

I think it might be because my jaw has been in a lot of pain, and I cant see my rheumatologist until the end of October and it is difficult to eat and talk because of the pain. I had depression badly when I was younger but I haven't been feeling depressed for a couple of years now so I don't know if it is just normal sadness or if it is becoming a problem again.

I just feel lost, sad, and off and not myself. I find it hard to motivate myself to do something, even if it is something little like making a cup of tea or having a shower.

I wanted to make this post because I would like to vent about my mental wellbeing because it has been all over the place recently. When I wrote my earlier posts while I was in Year 11 (2019), I was in a very bad place because of my mental health issues (depression and anxiety) overwhelming me, which resulted in a lot of bad thoughts, and I was just not a good mental space at all. This mental strain was caused by a lot of different reasons, such as a recent breakup, my best friend leaving my school, as well as dealing with the grief of losing my mother when I was young. I was losing hope. 

I got better during the end of year 11 and into year 12, (with the help of counselling and therapy) and I learnt to properly deal with it. I got used to being able to properly do my school work, and I think I did a pretty good job at it all things considered. Then, COVID happened. As I'm sure for a lot of people, this lockdown was awful. However, during the lockdown, I developed a relationship with a girl I had feelings for a long time. This relationship made me very happy and made me able to appreciate and value what I had at the time, and during the whole of 2020. We could talk about anything, and I felt like she really valued me for me. Even if I did something completely stupid she wouldn't care at all. At the end of Year 12, I did well in my exams and even got into my dream uni for my dream course (which I am currently studying right now). I felt like I was on top of the world.

Then, a few weeks after my 18th birthday and my school formal, she broke up with me. I had seen it coming for a while, we were growing distant, but I still valued it a lot nonetheless. I was still excited for the next few months to come because I thought we were going to do a bunch of things together, such as go on holiday, but it wasn't meant to be. Following the weeks after that breakup, I was very distant with my family and friends, as I expected. I quit my job and barely did anything for the few months between the end of high school and university, it was very depressing. Because of that long break of not doing anything, and the isolation from the breakup, these issues from year 11 have come back up, and I regularly experience high amounts of stress as well as low moments.

I now have a new job (after months of looking for one) and am studying at uni, and I think both are going relatively well. I have made new friends at both and really like hanging out with all of them (as well as my friends from high school). However, I am having a lot of trouble adjusting to this lifestyle. Going from barely doing anything to having a week full of doing assignments and shifts at my new job is very overwhelming. I do have a regular therapist that I see once a fortnight and that is going quite well as well, she helps me out a lot. 

Anyways, that's it for my rant. I probably missed a bit of information but this is all I could think of to talk about hahaha. I very much appreciate anyone who reads this, and I hope you have a nice day :red_heart: ",

This is my first post and first time on Reach Out forums. I'm really relieved to find this community space, with caring, like minded people to talk to :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:

 

I just wanted to ask for some support as I've been going through friendship difficulties with my best mate (lets call him Gary). I've noticed over the past couple of months that I haven't gotten along with him very well. We've seemed to have drifted apart and I haven't felt comfortable speaking to Gary like I used to. It's a real shame because we were the bestest of friends back in high school and we hung out heaps :pensive_face:

 

Unfortunately, Gary's been really prioritising work and family life recently, and hasn't been there for me when I've needed it. It certainly hasn't helped with the whole covid situation though, as we haven't been able to hang out much. Gary also isn't much of a texter or caller, which makes it hard to stay in touch with him.


I think the most challenging part of this friendship is that Gary is heavily involved in his local church, and it's something that he's extremely dedicated to. I'm not against Gary's decisions, but he certainly prioritises this over his friends, which can really hurt. I've tried going to his church and getting involved myself, but it really didn't work out in the end, and it actually caused a lot of pain. I've known Gary for quite sometime now, but I feel like we're just not bonding like we used to. My beliefs and values have shifted away from Gary's, and the more I learn what his opinions are, the more differences I find between us.

 

I'm in a tough situation right now. I'm not sure whether I should continue this friendship or end it? Either way, it will probably be a really tough call to make. I feel that by ending this friendship, it will hurt Gary's feelings deeply. However, if I continue this friendship, will it just prolong the pain I'm feeling?

 

I look forward to hearing from a friendly responder soon. Thanks so much for the support guys, it's really appreciated!

Friendly Wednesday message to let you legends know I’ll be leaving ReachOut as a participant/user pretty soon. Apart from the fact that my 26th birthday is approaching next year, I’ve got a growing  family (yep ????  :family_man_woman_boy_boy:) to focus on and my business is picking up with speed, to the point where I’m putting another staff member on to help me.

 

I feel really well supported by the people around me now and although things are really busy, I am starting to settle into what I want my life to look like. I’ll pop on for three positives, and I’ll try and do that every day, maybe every two days but apart from that, I’ll be off. 

 

It’s been unreal. After two accounts and 23,211 posts over 6.5 years, I’m officially handing in my resignation from this awesome space. The last 6.5 years has been huge for me, I can’t list the number of things RO has helped me get through.

 

Thanks to all the staff including some who aren’t on RO anymore, you’ve all been incredible, showing patience and support to me in some of my most difficult times, the work you do doesn’t go unappreciated, I hope that at the end of each and everyday you recognise that importance of the work you do. 

 

Thanks to all the users that make this space exactly what it is, a safe, supportive, diverse place where it is ok to not be ok, and the opportunity to hold someone’s else’s virtual hand if you are doing ok.

 

 

I didn’t use the space a lot in the last year or two, but with COVID things obviously got a bit tough.

But now, I feel confident enough to head out into this big wide world, maybe find a “grown up” forum to hang out in, or maybe not, I might manage just fine with what I have right now.

 

Can’t say thanks enough, and I’ll be around for the next few months just minimally and when the time is right I’ll log out for the last time.

I just wanted to kinda vent and get some thoughts down. I've been feeling really up and down at the moment, unfortunately however the 'ups' are me only feeling detached and indifferent, while the 'downs' are really, really down.

I'm so sick of COVID-19. All I see on social media is people telling others to ~stay productive!~ and I see everyone finding new ways to connect with friends. I sound incredibly selfish, but it's only making me feel worse. I've completely lost my routine, and I haven't absolutely no motivation to do... anything. Whether it's uni, or playing games I should enjoy. Nothing's really making me happy, and I mostly spend the day exhausted lying in bed.

I don't know why I can't just enjoy things. For example, I find myself starting to even dislike Animal Crossing, one of my favourite games, because it makes me so anxious I don't have the energy to create an amazing town and I don't have any friends to play with. Same with writing -- why did I base my entire identity around something I can't even do? I feel like every single person is super talented and interesting but me. 

I just feel like I'm always going to be trapped like this, with no hobbies or interests, nothing that really makes me happy, no friends... gahh.

I have been dealing with this for a long time so I'm sort of used to but it's much harder with been home all the time. I have had tough times with my family for a long time and what I mean by that is my sister started self-harming at a young age (were the same age, twins so I think we went through a lot of the same issues at the same time expect I learnt to cope with it at a younger age when I couldn't escape it because at times my sister would emotionally hurt me more than anyone else) and although she has gotten help and is now on medication for depression it's still hard with her mood swings at times. But even before that, my parents would argue all time and I never felt safe emotionally at home.

 

So because of that my mental health or anything about me took the back burner and understand it was needed but it's just hard because I always feel like I'm in the middle and I just feel so alone and like I have to put their needs before mine all the time and like its never enough. I feel all of this is been amplified with been home and unable to escape when they argue or feel the need to complain about the other person putting me in the middle or I just need some time alone but by the time I have time for myself I'm exhausted and have no energy left for myself with university work and family drama my energy is depleted. 

 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated or if you're going through/have been through the same thing and willing to share your story that would be greatly appreciated. Help people remember their not alone in this. Thanks",

Its really tough at the moment, and some of us are on the brink. For lots of people the announcements today are disappointing but for others it means people are able to sit outside in a park with their family and that could mean the world. 

 

I’m in regional Victoria and I was upset by some of the announcements. Even though we have been lucky enough to have relative freedom for the last 4 weeks in regional it doesn’t make the unknowns easier. People are making comparisons about how lucky we are and I agree, but it’s still tough. 

Even though I saw it coming I won’t be able to see my mentors, who are my family to me quite possibly a long time still, they are in metro Melbourne, I don’t know if we will have a Christmas with them, I haven’t seen them for months. We are missing out on things that weren’t even on our radar a year ago, little things. No birthdays parties, no visits to the city for a day out, no Sunday lunches with the family which we used to do a lot, no activities or social groups most are still closed, just being allowed to attend an appointment with my partner is like I’m asking somebody to cut their left arm off.

 

I’m feeling really flat, disappointed and sad today, and perhaps grieving what we used to have, when we could just go somewhere, no booking required, no masks, no time limit, no person limit - you want to visit this person, go ahead! 


My work is so up and down at the minute while my partner is flat stick working from home supporting people who are struggling and can’t fit it all in.

 

It’s hard to put a positive spin on something, as much as we try to, it’s hard when it feels like we are just being given dog treats to keep us happy for a minute. 


I let myself be annoyed and sad for a minute, and then I went outside, and took our toddler for a walk. We saw the ducks at the “creek” near our house, which usually resembles a puddle with overgrown plants but with all this rain had water in it. And he chased all the seagulls away from us while we tried to sit and eat at the oval. 

 

And I started think about how he has been the little bit of light that has gotten us through this, creating fun and laughter in our house and full of joy no matter what, embracing the small things like the pop of the toaster at 6 in the morning which turns into a dance, or the mail man driving past on his motorbike.

 

I hope you can find your little bit of light to get through the next couple of weeks, and hopefully all of my friends in Melbourne can get some more eased restrictions soon, and maybe we can all have a nice Christmas with our families. 

 

 

If you want to share your little bit of good that’s gotten you through to now please share.

We will get through this. ",

A lot of us were pretty keen to say goodbye to 2020 and while it’s going to be great to wave farewell to that bizarre year, some of us are feeling 2021 hasn’t exactly gotten off to the rosiest of starts. Things are pretty stressful for everyone right now. With increased covid restrictions in many parts of Australia, its understandable to be feeling anxious, angry, uncertain and annoyed. 

 

These restrictions also meant that many of us didn’t get the holiday break that we wanted and deserved. We may not have been able to see all the family or friends that we were keen to catch up with, or maybe the break wasn’t the restful, relaxing time we were hoping for.  

 

In light of this, we wanted to make sure there was a space for all of us to share our tips for coping and have a look at some other threads that might be helpful. After all, it’s only the 5th day - plenty of time to make 2021 the year of YOU!

 

We had an awesome chat a few months ago with Dr Joe in the Ask Me Almost Anything on Life After Social Isolation where we chatted about managing changes and looking after ourselves. Here’s a few takeaways from that chat:

 

It is really important to acknowledge that this is a really hard time and for us all to be kind to each other - as in - be kind to yourself.

Most things that were steady and safe and fundamental in our lives have been shaken up.

 

Good comes out of every challenge I think. We decide what attitude we want to use to approach covid and everything else. We learn about ourselves. 

 

Things do change all the time even without covid. The present moment however is not uncertain – this moment – right now - and it is in this moment that we plan. We don’t plan IN the future we plan FOR the future. Maybe all we can do is make those plans in the present and hope for the best.

 

Acceptance is everything but not easy. If we can accept the changes, the challenges, it is easier to live with. We will come out of this in time even if it doesn’t feel like it at times. We have to adapt. Humans always adapt and try to be grateful and positive if we can.

I am able to superficially converse with people, and can appear calm and confident and interested whilst dying inside

It’s my special talent

 

My own trust issues aside, I require a deep connection with someone to consider them a ‘friend’

Sometimes I feel like my friendships have a four year expiry date

I’ve never been able to keep a friend for longer than that

 

Recently, I thought I had the two best friends I’d ever had in my life

We had the same favourite tv shows, sense of humour, shared everything, had hundreds of private jokes and helped each other get through ATAR

Things fell apart one year after graduating

One friend moved to Sydney and is too busy with uni and family and religious commitments to stay in contact

The other friend is a little more complicated

After one semester of uni, she went overseas as a nanny for a family

Covid broke out whilst she was there, so the eight month trip turned into eighteen months

Things were fine between us for a long time, and we managed to stay in contact until the last couple of months of her trip

 

I think I would have been upset but okay with it if stuff ended there with both of them

I’d still be excited to visit and spend the occasional weekend with them whenever they were free

 

However

Over the last year, my mental health took a turn for the worse

I had a bad reaction to some medication and ended up basically having what my mum described as a combination of vertigo and morning sickness for five months


My friends started leaving my texts on read, and then change the subject hours later

I had thought their lack of ability to provide emotional support during high school was a result of their own stressors (they had their own problems - I did not expect them to comfort me when I was crying in high school)

But what I found out over the last two years is that they are just unable to be emotionally supportive in general

 

The turning point for me happened on the anniversary of my Aunt’s death this year

I texted to tell my friends that the weekend would be a messy one, and apologised if I was unable to answer texts

I know that it might be hard to know what to say to someone in that situation, but I’m pretty sure leaving me on read about being upset about my Aunt’s recent death is not the right response 

 

The overseas friend is back now, and we’ve caught up a couple of times, but I just find it anxiety inducing and afterwards I’m glad it’s over

But anyway, onto my current predicament:

 

Last month I decided to move out of my parents' house during the COVID-19 pandemic, while still on centrelink, to a sharehouse in a close suburb for 150 per week. I was operating under the assumption that if I moved out I would be motivated to look for a job. It SORTA worked, in the sense that I have been actively looking for work, but it has also been quite stressful. My housemates are polite, but they're quite distant, and I've noticed myself waking up every night at 4am feeling anxious. I also woke up screaming one time and they didn't do or say anything, just pretended they didn't hear me. I know it can be awkward to deal with that but I still felt horrible, and alone. I think part of the reason I moved out in the first place was because I felt constricted in my parents' house, and also because I barely discussed the decision with anyone. I am confident that if I ask to move back in my parents will be okay with it, but it will be awkward because my sister took my old room.

 

I guess I don't have a specific question, I just wanted to articulate my thoughts on this matter, and feel like im heard.",

I needed an outlet for my pain because what i feel is somehow too shameful to share with those closest to me. Writing this now even feels like a stretch into desperation because i'm not the type to divulge my innermost feelings on some virtual platform. 

i know many others feel as i do. 

I've been struggling with loneliness for what feels like a long time. It comes in waves. There are periods of time where it ceases to exist but it seems to always return. 

I believe that perhaps i have something to learn from this suffering and that one day it will be unburdened from my heart. But for now it is eating me away inside and I cannot bear to feel it any longer. 

Loneliness is something that feeds on shame and fear. I feel scared to tell people how I feel because they might not understand/relate or that it'd change the way they see me. 

There is this slight sense of repulsion that comes with loneliness, even the word carries embarrassment one wants to hide. So i don't tell anyone and keep it stuffed inside where it festers. 

Obviously the advent of covid has inflamed these feelings and with social media our current state fo disconnect. 

To love and have true intimacy requires vulnerability which terrifies me. But perhaps this is what I must overcome. Life's richness comes from the connections and experiences we have with people (and of course with ourselves and nature). And that is what I desire, open-heartedness, kindness, lovingness, compassion, generosity and intimacy. 

 

I'm writing this so other might feel comfortable enough to share your own experiences of loneliness because it is something that needs to be talk about. 

If anyone has any advice or wisdom to share also that'd be kindly appreciated.

I’ve known about their mental health concerns (they’re very anxious, potentially depressed, self harms a lot) for a few years. I was emailing kidshelpline last year but I found I got a bit stressed out from pressure to tell people what they’re going’s through so I stopped emailing :confused_face: The main reason I’m going to try and share again is because they’ve been getting worse. At the start of this year they stopped texting on our friendship group’s chat, and stopped texting me and most of our other friends personally. Of the one friend they did text, I’m not sure if they still talk about how they’re feeling. More recently (this developed during the last school term) they’ve started getting bad days where they don’t talk to me or any of my friends at all, don’t make eye contact and generally ignore people when they talk to them about how they’re feeling, or, like, anything in general.

I graduated from year 12 last year. It felt amazing to have finally finished, especially since I'd finished with straight VHA (very high achievement) scores. Virtually everyone in the cohort respected me. But I had struggled to make friends throughout school, largely due to my poor social skills because of my Asperger's syndrome. Although I had the quantity of friends I wanted at the end of school, I wasn't particularly close to any of them. Hence, when school ended, there wasn't much I could do to maintain them. They all had much larger friendship groups that they could spend time with, so I very much wasn't a priority. I've tried to keep in contact with my old friends as much as possible, but it's at the point where our conversations (over Messenger) are shallow. This is especially the case since almost always, I am the one to initiate the conversation.

 

An opportunity for a relationship came up the day after my formal. A friend asked me if I liked her. I said yes, and I was truthful. But since I was 15, I've struggled to have romantic feelings for girls. I don't know why this is and I'm seeing a relationship psychologist about it. So, because my feelings for my friend weren't very strong, I struggled to be affectionate with her, and flirt, etc.. She had promised me that should would wait for me to fix my issue, but she got tired of the lack of romance. She's dating someone else now. I was heartbroken when I found out, especially since now she doesn't talk to me much because it feels awkward. I haven't actually seen her since because COVID-19 has been prohibitive. She promised that we could still be friends, but I can tell that will be very difficult. I am, however, going to try my best.

 

I'm in the position where it seems almost impossible to make new friends and to revitalise my old ones. With the exception of my brother, I don't really have any friends anymore. I don't feel good about myself anymore like I used to in school. The lack of connections has made me feel unwanted and so I feel inadequate now. It was my 18th last week, though the day just made me feel worse because I didn't have friends I could spend it with. Although I still excel academically in university, this doesn't really do much for me anymore.

 

Any help would be appreciated. Whether that's in building new friendships, improving social skills or helping my self-esteem.",

I'm new here and was hoping that I might be able to find some people who are experiencing something similar to myself. 

I've been working on my anxiety for a bit over a year now. I had a rough time for a while, but connected with a therapist and started feeling like I was making real progress. Now with everything that has been going on in ths crazy year, I feel  like that progress has gone kind of down the toilet and I'm feeling as though I've taken steps backwards.

One major thing that I've noticed lately is that when my anxiety flares up (for instance when we receive news of increasing cases and new COVID restrictions), I start to get irritable and angry. A lot of the time this comes out as responses to really little things. Someone talking too loud or too much becomes a big problem, my sense of humour disappears and I find myself snapping all the time. This is affecting my relationships with those close to me because they see my reactions as unnecessary and out of proportion, but I don't know how to manage it. I end up withdrawing from them and spending more time alone which in itself is not helpful. 

So, if anyone has any suggestions of strategies that have helped them with anxiety related irritability, or even if you're experiencing the same thing at the moment, I'd really love to hear from you.

So share your story and recipes or hobbies advice or things yuo do yourself to help others find something to look forward. Remember that rest, work and playtime are just important as each other and we need to start prioritising them.",

The past few years it has felt like my motivation has been draining out of me. It's feeling like it's harder and harder to do my uni work. I don't even think I will pass some of my subjects this semester...

To be fair to myself, there has been a lot that has happened in the past few years. My best friend had an eating disorder and ended up in the intensive care unit and had to stay in hospital for weeks, where I visited her. A year or so later my younger sister went through the same thing. My parents already had a bad relationship and then my sister's disorder made everything more intense. There was arguing and fighting every night. Every family dinner became a nightmare. My parents talked and talked about getting a divorce, though it never happened. 

Sometime while all this was happening I finished year 12, grateful my time at my last high school was over (I had three different high-schools, and the last one was my least favorite). I moved out to live at the uni but couldn't cope and ended up back home. I was miserable at home with all the fighting and a part of me was sad I had moved back, and the other part was just glad to have people I knew around me. 

I went through various part-time jobs while still doing uni, some good, some not so good. Got my Ps (finally). Then Covid hit and I had all my classes online and basically lived like a hermit, never going out. I actually had to go to the doctors at the end of 2020, because I was scared to go out.

Skip to now, where my parents have decided to move states. I've spent my time trying to juggle full-time uni, work placement, and a part-time job, while looking for a place to rent in a city that is having a rental crisis. I had to quit my part-time job because I was barely keeping on top of uni and I honestly feel like I have nothing left to give. Like there is nothing to look forward to in life anymore. It just feels like an endless slog. 

I look ahead of me... moving out, uni, part-time jobs - it all seems so hard and so lonely. ",

I am in my second year of a 5 year degree, and I’m really struggling to cope in lockdown. I live alone, work 30 hours a week teaching/tutoring and study full time (3 units instead of 4 but still full time). I take 3 instead of 4 due to complex mental health issues, I have OCPD and see a psychologist and psychiatrist regularly.

 

Currently, I am feeling so overwhelmed and unmotivated to complete uni work, everything is stressing me out and it feels too much. My entire first year was lost to covid, it was all online, and most of my units in the first semester of this year were online. I have very few uni friends, but the few I do have are wonderful but not in my degree. 

 

I am taking it one day a time, but when everyday is “one of the bad ones”, it’s hard and so tiring. I’m overwhelmed by the news, I’m unable to see my friends and family as I’m in an LGA of concern. I am finding it so hard to focus on my study and I just end up breaking down in tears every time I try. 

I don’t know if I should drop back to part time and do 2 units this semester, or just keep pushing through and try and manage. I feel guilt over extending my degree even further and I’m unsure what to do.

 

At the moment, I don’t know anyone in my personal life who is dealing with this and was wondering if anyone on here might have some insight.  I feel like everyone in my zoom-tuts are coping with it just fine, they’re upbeat and seem to be managing all the work and material in lockdown.

 

thank you all in advance!! ",
